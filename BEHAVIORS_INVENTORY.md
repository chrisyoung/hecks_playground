# Hecks behaviors inventory — 2026-04-21

Scope: `origin/main`, 454 `.behaviors` files across `hecks_conception/`.
Runners: Rust `storehouse/target/release/storehouse behaviors <path>`, Ruby `bin/hecks-behaviors <path>`.
Method: every file run through both runners; classified by exit code and summary line.

Total: 454 files

  pass_both:        127  (28.0%)
  pass_rust_only:   327  (72.0%)
  pass_ruby_only:     0
  fail_both:          0
  no_aggregate:       0

## Summary

The Rust runner is green on **all 454** files. The Ruby runner fails on **327 / 454** — in every case because the `.bluebook` source cannot be loaded into the Ruby DSL, not because of domain behaviour. In other words: every failure is a Ruby-runner parser/DSL gap, not a domain-logic bug. No orphan behaviors (no `.behaviors` whose sibling `.bluebook` is missing on main).

### Ruby-runner failure patterns (327 total)

| Pattern | Count | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `list_of(<UserType>) :attr` — Ruby DSL chokes on typed lists of user-defined types | 173 | `list_of(TargetingRule) :targeting_rules` |
| `Use bare constant X instead of string "X"` — reference/state defined as string in bluebook | 131 | `adapters/heki.bluebook` (Binding / System) |
| `undefined method 'TrueClass'` — Ruby validator rejects `TrueClass` as attribute type | 4 | `nursery/acoustics` et al. |
| Other parser errors | 18 | various |
| Partial pass (Ruby runner genuinely failed a cascade test) | 1 | `actions/compost_seasonal_beings.behaviors` (Rust 9/9, Ruby 8/9) |

The single partial-pass case is the only file where the Ruby runner gets past parsing and then fails a *test*: `Reverse cascades through policy chain` in `compost_seasonal_beings.behaviors`. All 9 tests pass under Rust. This is the one honest Ruby-runner regression that is not a parser/DSL gap.

## fail_both (real bugs, candidates for fix)

_None._

## pass_ruby_only (investigate)

_None._

## pass_rust_only (Ruby runner gap) — 327

Dominant signal: the Ruby DSL (`lib/hecks/bluebook/**`) lags the Rust parser on (a) `list_of(UserType) :name` syntax, (b) string-valued references/states where Rust accepts both string and bare constant, and (c) `TrueClass` as an attribute type. Fixing those three would likely reclaim most of the 327.

## no_aggregate (orphan behaviors)

_None. Every `.behaviors` file has a sibling `.bluebook`, and the Rust runner successfully located the aggregate under test in every case._

## Methodology notes

- Inventory uses the sibling-bluebook heuristic (`X.behaviors` ↔ `X.bluebook`) that matches what `bin/hecks-behaviors` does at line 25-27.
- Under `origin/main` every `.behaviors` file had a matching `.bluebook`; none of the 454 files hit a "no source bluebook" condition in either runner.
- The summary line for each run is captured from the `N passed, M failed, K errored` output of each runner; exit code 0 is the classification signal.
- One file (`hecks_conception/aggregates/bluebook.behaviors`, 0 passed / 0 failed / 0 errored in both runners) is classified `pass_both` — it is a stub file with no `test` blocks yet, not an orphan.
- The antibody file (`hecks_conception/capabilities/antibody/antibody.behaviors`) appears on feature branches but not on `origin/main`; excluded from the 454 count.
