# Hecks::Audit
#
# Audit trail extension that records an immutable log entry for every
# domain event published on the event bus. Captures the event class name,
# full attribute data, and timestamp. Optionally pairs with command bus
# middleware to enrich entries with command name, actor, and tenant.
#
# Future gem: hecks_audit
#
# Usage:
#   require "hecks_audit"
#
#   app = Hecks.load(domain)
#   audit = Hecks::Audit.new(app.event_bus)
#
#   # Optional: add command context via middleware
#   app.use(:audit) { |cmd, nxt| audit.around_command(cmd, nxt) }
#
#   Pizza.create(name: "Margherita")
#   audit.log.last[:event_name]  # => "CreatedPizza"
#   audit.log.last[:event_data]  # => { name: "Margherita" }
