# HecksAuth
#
# Authentication and authorization extension for Hecks domains. Reads
# actor metadata from the DSL and registers command bus middleware that
# enforces access control. Commands without actors are always allowed;
# commands with actor declarations require a matching role on the current
# +Hecks.actor+.
#
# The extension builds a lookup table mapping fully-qualified command class
# names to their required actor roles (from the DSL). On each command
# dispatch, the middleware checks whether the current actor's role is in
# the allowed list. Raises +Hecks::Unauthenticated+ if no actor is set,
# or +Hecks::Unauthorized+ if the actor's role is not permitted.
