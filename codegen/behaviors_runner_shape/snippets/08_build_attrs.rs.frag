/// Build the attrs map for a runtime dispatch from the test DSL's
/// reference-only world. Two layers:
///
/// 1. Convert the user-typed kwargs (domain attrs only — no ids).
/// 2. For every reference declared on the command, inject the in-scope
///    id automatically. The user never types an id; the runner looks
///    up "the most recently created Pizza" from in_scope and provides
///    the runtime its internal id. This is the bluebook→repository
///    translation: above, references; below, ids.
///
/// If a reference can't be resolved (no in-scope aggregate of that
/// type), the kwarg is omitted — the runtime will then either error
/// (loud, useful failure pointing at missing setup) or singleton-create
/// for is_create commands.
