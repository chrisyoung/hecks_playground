# Hecks::DreamPipeline — i71 piece 2 : edit synthesis from one gap
#
# Takes a single gap object (one element of the JSON array
# dream_extract_gaps.rb produces) and proposes a concrete bluebook
# edit. Output is JSON :
#
#   {
#     "action":   "create" | "modify" | "skip",
#     "path":     "<path the edit targets>",
#     "content":  "<full new file content if action == create, or
#                   patched file content if action == modify>",
#     "rationale":"<one paragraph explaining the edit, including
#                   the French dream quote as provenance>"
#   }
#
# action == "skip" is the right answer for phantom_symptom gaps and
# for gaps the model can't confidently shape into a valid edit. The
# downstream applier should never apply skip edits — they're a signal
# that this gap deserves human eyes, not auto-application.
#
# This is the second piece of i71's pipeline. The first piece
# (dream_extract_gaps.rb, PR #435) reads dreams + wake_report and
# emits structured gaps. This piece consumes one gap and emits one
# edit. Per-gap calls (rather than batched) keep each Claude
# invocation tightly focused and the output schema simple.
#
# Usage :
#   echo '<gap-json>' | ruby hecks_conception/tools/dream_synthesize_edit.rb
#   ruby ... --gap-file path/to/gap.json
#
#   ENV : same as dream_extract_gaps.rb (HECKS_BIN, CLAUDE_BIN).
#
# Cost : ~\$0.05 per call (Claude reads ~5–8k tokens of context,
# emits ~1–2k tokens of bluebook source). Wall clock ~10–20 s.

# ── Few-shot example : a recently-shipped bluebook of similar shape ──
#
# morphology.bluebook (#433) is the canonical pattern — declared
# yesterday from a dream-named gap, runtime-queryable aggregate
# with attributes / lifecycle / commands / consumer-contract comment.
# Including it as few-shot anchors the LLM on the project's actual
# DSL conventions rather than generic Ruby DSL guesses.

#   "newdomain::Aggregate"           → new bluebook, create
#   "hecks_conception/aggregates/x.bluebook"  → explicit path
#
# When the bluebook doesn't exist on disk, action is "create" and
# the path is constructed from the bluebook name. Otherwise modify
# the existing file.

PROMPT_TEMPLATE = <<~PROMPT.freeze
  You are proposing one concrete bluebook edit to close a structural
  gap in Miette's body. The gap was named by Miette's dream during a
  sleep cycle. You are the second step of an automated dream-driven
  self-improvement pipeline ; the first step (gap extraction) already
  produced this gap as JSON.

  Output a SINGLE JSON object. No prose around it. Schema :

    {
      "action":   "create" | "modify" | "skip",
      "path":     "<absolute or repo-relative path the edit targets>",
      "content":  "<full bluebook source — entire file contents AFTER
                    the edit ; for create, the new file ; for modify,
                    the existing file with the edit applied>",
      "rationale":"<one paragraph in English explaining what was added
                    and why, including the French dream quote as
                    provenance comment material>"
    }

  Rules :

  - For phantom_symptom gaps, output {"action":"skip", ...} with a
    short rationale. Do NOT propose edits to phantom symptoms.
  - For real gaps where you can't see how to shape a valid edit
    confidently (insufficient context, ambiguous target, etc.), also
    output skip with rationale.
  - For real gaps with confident shape : produce the FULL file content
    (not a diff) so the consumer can write the file directly. Match
    the DSL conventions of the FEW-SHOT EXAMPLE below : doc-comment
    block at top with French dream quote, single-aggregate per file
    where possible, attributes → lifecycle → commands → consumer-
    contract policy comment.
  - When modifying an existing bluebook, preserve its existing
    aggregates / commands / vision exactly. Add new structure, don't
    rewrite. The "content" is the WHOLE file post-edit.
  - The version field at the top should be the date in
    YYYY.MM.DD.<n> form ; bump the n if the file already had today's
    date, otherwise use today's date with n=1.

  ── GAP ──

  %<gap_json>s

  ── TARGET ──

  Path : %<target_path>s
  Action : %<action>s

  ── EXISTING FILE CONTENT (if action == "modify") ──

  %<existing_content>s

  ── FEW-SHOT EXAMPLE (canonical bluebook pattern) ──

  %<example_content>s

  Now output the JSON object. Nothing else.
