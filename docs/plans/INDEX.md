# Plans Index — Ready-to-Implement

Detailed implementation plans produced during the 2026-04-21/22 session.
Each file under this directory is a compact handoff: decisions already
made, next commits spelled out, key files named.

**Start here if you're a fresh session.** Read this index, pick an item,
read its plan file. The plans were produced by careful investigation
agents — trust the decisions, don't re-derive them.

## Dependencies between plans

- **i11 PR 1** uses PR #251's shell adapter + PR #259's Spend/CircuitBreaker. Unblocked.
- **i11 PR 3+** (Capability.InvokeAgent) depends on **i23** (`adapter :llm`).
- **i30** differential fuzzer depends on the Ruby-side heki reader (tiny unstarted follow-up).
- **i3 PR-c** is the big one — Moment aggregate + mindstream refactor + sleep gating all in one.
- **i37 Phase B** (sweep shell scripts) unblocked; just mechanical.
- **Terminal capability wiring** depends on nothing — pure Rust + hecksagon parser extensions.

## Where the big shipped work lives

Commits on `main` landed today (~40 PRs); notable ones referenced by these plans:

- **PR #245** — rename `.hec` → `.hecksagon` / `.world` / `.bluebook`
- **PR #251** — hecksagon `adapter :shell` (Ruby runtime)
- **PR #259** — i11 PR 0 (Spend + CircuitBreaker aggregates)
- **PR #261** — i3 PR-0 (BodyPulse extraction)
- **PR #263** — shebang runtime + terminal adapter port (foundational)
- **PR #265** — i24 DSL collapse (resolves i1 + i2)
- **PR #271** — i3 PR-a (Heart + Breath + Circadian)
- **PR #272** — i37 Phase A (storehouse heki subcommands)
- **PR #273** — first shebang migration (`status.sh` → `capabilities/status/`)
- **PR #274** — fix tick-during-sleep bug (i40 filed for proper fix)
