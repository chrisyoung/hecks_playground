# Behavioral Tests

Hecks generates behavioral tests for every bluebook automatically. The
tests run in pure memory — no hecksagon, no adapters, no IO — and use
the same DSL discipline as the source bluebooks.

## The pipeline

```
storehouse conceive-behaviors path/to/source.bluebook       # generate
storehouse behaviors          path/to/source_behavioral_tests.bluebook  # run
```

The generator walks the source IR and emits one test per command + one
per query into a sibling `_behavioral_tests.bluebook` file. The runner
boots `Runtime::boot(domain)` (no `data_dir`) and dispatches each test.

## The DSL

```ruby
Hecks.behaviors "Pizzas" do
  vision "Behavioral tests for the Pizzas domain"

  test "AddTopping appends to toppings" do
    setup  "CreatePizza", name: "Margherita", description: "Classic"
    tests  "AddTopping", on: "Pizza"
    input  name: "basil", amount: 5
    expect toppings_size: 1
  end

  test "ByDescription returns matching records" do
    tests  "ByDescription", on: "Pizza", kind: :query
    setup  "CreatePizza", name: "A", description: "classic"
    expect count: 1
  end
end
```

Four keywords inside `test`:

| Keyword  | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `tests`  | Required — names the command (or query, with `kind: :query`) under test |
| `setup`  | Zero or more — arrange-phase commands run before the test command |
| `input`  | The act-phase command/query arguments (no IDs — references inject from in-scope) |
| `expect` | Final-state assertions: `<attr>: value`, `<attr>_size: n`, `count: n`, `refused: "msg"` |

The bluebook layer is **id-free**. The runner maintains a per-test
in-scope map (aggregate type → id) populated by setups and consumed
when injecting reference kwargs to dispatch. Test authors never type
`pizza: 1` or `order: 1` — they speak the domain.

## Validators

Three commands gate bluebook health:

```bash
storehouse check-lifecycle <bluebook>          # transitions, givens, mutation refs
storehouse check-io        <bluebook>          # bluebook stays in-memory
storehouse check-all       <bluebook>          # both at once
```

Add `--strict` to promote warnings to errors.

### `check-lifecycle`

Catches structural contradictions:

- **Unreachable from_state** — a transition's `from:` value isn't the
  lifecycle default and isn't the to_state of any other transition. The
  transition is dead code.
- **Stuck default** — the lifecycle has transitions but none can fire
  from the default. Aggregate is permanently stuck (warning).
- **Unreachable given** — `given { status == "X" }` where no command
  produces that state.
- **Mutation references undefined symbol** — `then_set :event, to: :event`
  where the command has no `:event` attribute or reference. The field
  stays null at runtime.

### `check-io`

Asserts the bluebook is pure-memory:

- **Static IR scan** — flags IO-suggestive command names (`Deploy`,
  `Send`, `Push`, `Publish`), past-tense external event names
  (`Deployed`, `Sent`), and pure-side-effect commands (emits but no
  state change, not Create/lifecycle).
- **Runtime smoke** — boots `Runtime::boot(domain)` and dispatches
  every dispatchable command. Lifecycle violations and missing attrs
  are expected (not IO); anything else is a hard error.

## Cascade lockdown (VCR-style)

For every command whose emit fires a policy chain, the conceiver emits
a second test that asserts the **exact ordered list of events** the
runtime will publish:

```ruby
test "PlaceOrder cascades through policy chain" do
  tests "PlaceOrder", on: "CakeOrder", kind: :cascade
  setup "ScheduleTasting", date: "sample", client_name: "sample", sample_count: 1
  setup "ProposeFlav", cake_flavor: "sample", filling: "sample", frosting: "sample"
  setup "StockIngredient", ingredient_name: "sample", category: "sample", quantity: 1.0, unit: "sample"
  setup "ScheduleCakeDelivery", address: "sample", delivery_date: "sample", time_window: "sample", handler_name: "sample"
  input client_name: "sample", occasion: "sample", tier_count: 1, servings: 1, delivery_date: "sample"
  expect emits: ["OrderPlaced", "TastingScheduled", "FlavorProposed",
                 "TastingConducted", "FlavorApproved", "OrderConfirmed",
                 "BakingStarted", "IngredientConsumed", "OrderCompleted",
                 "CakeDeliveryScheduled", "CakeDeliveryCompleted"]
end
```

The expected list is computed by the **static cascade walker**
(`storehouse/src/cascade.rs`), which mirrors the runtime's policy
engine: a policy is blocked while on the recursion stack (allowing
diamond fan-in but blocking self-recursion).

Add or remove a policy, retarget a trigger, change an emit name —
the predicted list changes and the test breaks immediately.

### Cross-aggregate cascade setups

The generator walks `aggregates_touched_by_cascade` and emits a
`Create` setup for every aggregate the cascade will hop through. Without
this, a cross-aggregate triggered command can't find its target
record and the cascade halts.

### Two dispatch modes

- `dispatch` — cascades policies. Used by `kind: :cascade` tests.
- `dispatch_isolated` — skips policy drain. Used by **setups** so
  they don't overshoot the precondition state being tested.

## Operators in givens

| Operator             | Example                                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `==` `!=`            | `status == "approved"`                      |
| `>=` `<=` `>` `<`    | `priority >= 1`                             |
| `.any?` `.empty?`    | `tags.any?`, `errors.empty?`                |
| `&&` `\|\|`          | `status == "open" \|\| status == "review"` |

`&&` binds tighter than `\|\|`. Splits skip operators inside quoted
strings. No parentheses or short-circuit nuances beyond left-to-right
recursion — keep givens linear.

## Mutation values

`then_set :field, to: <value>` accepts:

- Symbols (`:attr_name`) — pulls from command attrs, then state
- Numbers (`42`, `3.14`) — parsed as Int / Str
- Strings (`"literal"`) — quoted
- Booleans (`true`, `false`) — bare keywords
- Lists (`[]`, `[a, b]`) — empty list or list of resolved items
- Hashes (`{ k: v, ... }`) — map of resolved items

## Pre-commit gates

The pre-commit hook (`tooling/git-hooks/pre-commit`) blocks commits that:
1. Break Ruby↔Rust parser parity (`spec/parity/parity_test.rb`)
2. Have unreachable lifecycle transitions or givens (`check-lifecycle`)
3. Drift the two conceivers (`tests/conceiver_parity_test.rs`)

Bypass with `PARITY_SKIP=1` or `LIFECYCLE_SKIP=1` — but each is an
antibody failure.
