# Hecks DSL Reference

Complete reference for the Bluebook domain definition language.

## Quick Start — A Complete Domain

This example shows every major DSL feature in one domain. Copy it as a starting point.

```ruby

  end

  # --- Cross-aggregate policy ---
  policy "NotifyKitchen" do
    on "PlacedOrder"
    trigger "PrepareIngredients"
    map pizza: :pizza, quantity: :servings
  end

  # --- Domain service ---
  service "TransferOrder" do

  # --- Glossary ---
  glossary do
    prefer "customer", not: ["user", "client"]
    define "topping", as: "A measured ingredient applied to a pizza"
  end
end
```

Boot and use it:

```ruby
app = Hecks.boot(__dir__)

pizza = Pizza.create(name: "Margherita", description: "Classic", price: 12.0)
pizza.toppings.create(name: "Mozzarella", amount: 2)

order = Order.place(pizza: pizza, customer_name: "Alice", quantity: 3)
Order.pending  # => [order]

app.events.each { |e| puts e.class.name.split("::").last }
```

## Domain {#domain-1}

A domain is a bounded context with its own language, rules, and data.

```ruby
Hecks.domain "Pizzas" do
  description "Core pizza operations"
  # ...
end

Hecks.domain "Banking", version: "2026.04.01.1" do
  # CalVer versioning
end
```

See [Domain Versioning](domain_version.md) for version format details.

---

## Types

| Type | Aliases |
|------|---------|
| `String` | `:string`, `:str` |
| `Integer` | `:integer`, `:int` |
| `Float` | `:float` |
| `TrueClass` | `:boolean`, `:bool` |
| `Symbol` | `:symbol` |
| `Array` | `:array` |
| `Hash` | `:hash` |
| `Date` | `:date` |
| `DateTime` | `:datetime` |

Attribute options: `default:`, `enum:`, `pii:`.

```ruby
attribute :status, String, default: "draft"
attribute :role, String, enum: ["admin", "user"]
attribute :email, String, pii: true
attribute :toppings, list_of("Topping")
```

---

## Commands

Commands are intents to change state. Each infers a domain event (`CreatePizza` -> `CreatedPizza`). A self-referencing `reference_to` makes it an update; without one, it's a create.

```ruby
command "PlaceOrder" do
  description "Place a new order for a pizza"
  attribute :customer_name, String
  reference_to "Pizza", validate: :exists
  attribute :quantity, Integer
  guarded_by "MustBeAuthenticated"
  sets status: "pending"
  actor "Customer"
  method_name "place"
end
```

See [Emits](emits.md) for explicit event names.

### Given / Then — Declarative Behavior

Commands can declare preconditions (`given`) and state mutations (`then_set`) in pure ubiquitous language. No Ruby handlers — the runtime interprets them, and generators transpile them to any target.

```ruby
command "PlaceOrder" do
  description "Place a new order for a pizza"
  attribute :customer_name, String
  reference_to "Pizza", validate: :exists
  attribute :quantity, Integer

  given { quantity > 0 }
  given("customer must have name") { customer_name.length > 0 }

  then_set :status, to: "placed"
  then_set :items, append: { pizza: :pizza, quantity: :quantity }
  then_set :order_count, increment: 1
end
```

**`given`** — Precondition checked before execution. The block is captured as source text, not a Proc. Fails the command if false.

```ruby
given { toppings.size < 10 }
given("must be pending") { status == "pending" }
```

The behavioral test generator's chain planner reasons about a fixed
set of given shapes — express preconditions in one of these forms so
auto-generated tests can satisfy them automatically:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Equality | `given { status == "pending" }` |
| Boolean | `given { active == true }` |
| Integer ineq. | `given { quantity > 0 }`, `>= N`, `< N` |
| Float ineq. | `given { moisture_percent < 20.0 }` |
| List size | `given { items.size > 0 }`, `.any?`, `.empty?` |
| Cross-attr | `given { current_intake >= recommended_intake }` |

Opaque English-prose givens (`given "must be approved by review board"`)
generate skipped tests — the planner can't satisfy them. Rework as a
boolean attr + producing command:

```ruby
attribute :approved, TrueClass, default: false
command "Approve" do
  reference_to(Proposal)
  then_set :approved, to: true
end
command "Publish" do
  reference_to(Proposal)
  given { approved == true }     # ← planner can satisfy via Approve
end
```

**`then_set`** — Declarative state mutation applied after preconditions pass.

| Operation | Syntax | Effect |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Set | `then_set :field, to: value` | Assign value (literal or `:attribute_ref`) |
| Set (positional) | `then_set :field, value` | Shorthand for Set; bare literal (bool/number/symbol) |
| Append | `then_set :field, append: value` | Add to list |
| Increment | `then_set :field, increment: n` | Add n to numeric field |
| Decrement | `then_set :field, decrement: n` | Subtract n from numeric field |

The positional form is accepted for parity with the Rust line-scanner (`then_set :online, true` → `{op: set, value: "true"}`). Use the keyword form for string values — strings MUST use `to: "..."` so both runtimes agree on the canonical IR.

**`then_toggle`** — Toggle a boolean string field between `"true"` and `"false"`.

```ruby
then_toggle :sidebar_collapsed
```

Values can reference command attributes by symbol:

```ruby
then_set :name, to: :name          # copies from command input
then_set :status, to: "active"     # literal value
then_set :items, append: { name: :name, amount: :amount }  # compound
```

When `given`/`then_set` are present, the runtime uses `HecksalInterpreter` instead of a handler block. This keeps domain logic pure and projectable.

---

## Roles and Agents

> **Status — locked, parser pending.** This is the form the DSL is moving toward. The shape below is locked ; parser support is filed as a separate follow-up to i483 (the conception step landed first under that card so the bluebooks lead the runtime).
>
> Today's parser silently accepts the new form without lifting it into the IR — a bluebook using `role Role, as: Agent` parses cleanly under `storehouse inspect` and `storehouse check-lifecycle`, but the IR doesn't yet carry the typed reference. The legacy string form `role "Caller"` continues to work everywhere.

Every command runs in some role, filled by some agent. Today most bluebooks declare the role as a string label :

```ruby
command "Add" do
  role "Caller"          # untyped string — accidental consistency
  ...
end
```

Going forward, the role is a typed reference into the framework `Role` aggregate, and the role-bearer is named through the same type-plus-alias pattern as i255's `attribute Role, as: :role` :

```ruby
command "Add" do
  role Role, as: Agent   # Role is the type ; Agent is the alias for the role-bearer
  ...
end
```

Read it as : *"this command is dispatched in the role of `Role`, and the role-bearer is referenced as `Agent` in the command's attribute scope."* `Role` is an aggregate (`framework/agent/role.bluebook`) carrying a name and a permissions list ; `Agent` is the typed reference into the framework `Agent` aggregate (`framework/agent/agent.bluebook`).

### Narrowing by agent kind

A command may declare which agent kinds are allowed to dispatch it :

```ruby
command "Compile" do
  role Role, as: Agent, kind: "system"   # only system Agents may dispatch
  ...
end

command "Add" do
  role Role, as: Agent                    # any Agent kind may dispatch
  ...
end
```

The `kind:` filter is checked against the dispatching Agent's `kind` attribute (one of `"human"`, `"system"`, `"daemon"`, `"bot"`, `"ai"`). When omitted, any kind is permitted.

### What lands when

The conception step (the bluebooks under `framework/agent/` and the demonstration at `framework/audit/dispatch_audit.bluebook`) ships first. Parser, validator, and the mechanical sweep of existing `role "..."` strings each land in their own follow-up cards filed against i483. During the migration window both forms coexist ; once the sweep completes, the string form is retired.

### Cascade attribution

When a command emits an event that triggers cascading policies (e.g. `EnterSleep` fanning out through ten policies), the originating Agent reference flows automatically through the cascade. Downstream commands inherit the originator's Agent unless a policy explicitly re-attributes (the System Agent overrides for system-initiated cascades like garbage collection). The runtime wiring for this — `Dispatched` event payload carrying `dispatched_by: Agent` — is filed under i481.

### Companion : `actor`

`actor "Customer"` at the domain level (see [Actors](#actors)) is parallel to today's role-string and will converge with `role Role, as: Agent` once the migration completes. The direction of travel : `Agent` is the canonical noun, `Role` is the type, `actor` declarations migrate into Agent declarations at the framework level.

---

## References

Aggregates reference each other by identity, not containment.

```ruby
reference_to "Pizza"                           # name defaults to :pizza
reference_to "Team", as: :home_team            # explicit alias (canonical)
reference_to "Billing::Invoice"                # cross-domain
```

The `as:` kwarg is the canonical alias form. Legacy `role: :name` and
the trailing-symbol shorthand `reference_to(X) :name` are also accepted
by both parsers, but `as:` is preferred for new bluebooks.

See [Cross-Domain References](cross_domain_references.md).

---

## Value Objects

Immutable, no identity. Compared by value.

```ruby
value_object "Topping" do
  description "A measured ingredient"
  attribute :name, String
  attribute :amount, Integer
  invariant "amount must be positive" do
    amount > 0
  end
end
```

---

## Entities

Mutable children with identity, owned by the aggregate.

```ruby
entity "LedgerEntry" do
  description "A single accounting entry"
  attribute :amount, Float
  attribute :description, String
end
```

---

## Lifecycle

State machine on a single attribute. The runtime enforces transitions.

```ruby
attribute :status, String, default: "draft" do
  transition "Submit" => "pending"
  transition "Approve" => "published", from: "pending"
  transition "Archive" => "archived", from: ["draft", "published"]
end
```

Generated predicates: `post.draft?`, `post.published?`.

---

## Validations

Field-level checks.

```ruby
validation :name, presence: true
validation :email, presence: true, type: String, uniqueness: true
```

---

## Invariants

Aggregate-level business rules checked after every state change.

```ruby
invariant "price must be positive" do
  price > 0
end
```

---

## Specifications

Named boolean predicates for filtering, branching, or validation.

```ruby
specification "HighRisk" do |loan|
  loan.principal > 50_000
end
```

Used in workflows: `when_spec("HighRisk") { step "ManualReview" }`.

---

## Policies

Reactive policies listen for events and trigger commands.

```ruby
policy "NotifyKitchen" do
  on "PlacedOrder"
  trigger "PrepareIngredients"
  async true
  map pizza: :pizza, quantity: :servings
  condition { |event| event.quantity > 5 }
end
```

Guard policies run before commands: `guarded_by "MustBeAdmin"`.

See [Domain-Level Policies](domain_level_policies.md) and [Policy Conditions](policy_conditions.md).

---

## Computed Attributes

Derived values — not stored, calculated from other attributes.

```ruby
computed :lot_size do
  area / 43560.0
end
```

See [Computed Attributes](computed_attributes.md).

---

## Identity

Natural key for human-meaningful lookups alongside UUID.

```ruby
aggregate "TeamCycle" do
  attribute :team, String
  attribute :start_date, Date
  identity :team, :start_date
end
```

---

## Glossary

Enforces ubiquitous language. Warns when banned terms appear.

```ruby
glossary do
  define "aggregate", as: "A cluster of domain objects treated as a unit"
  prefer "customer", not: ["user", "client"]
end
```

See [Glossary](glossary.md).

---

## Sagas

Long-running cross-aggregate coordination with compensation.

```ruby
saga "OrderFulfillment" do
  step "ReserveInventory", on_success: "ChargePayment", on_failure: "CancelOrder"
  step "ChargePayment",    on_success: "ShipOrder",     on_failure: "RefundReservation"
  step "ShipOrder"
  compensation "ReleaseInventory"
  compensation "RefundPayment"
end
```

See [Sagas](sagas.md).

---

## Booting

```ruby
# Standalone
app = Hecks.boot(__dir__)

# With SQL
app = Hecks.boot(__dir__, adapter: :sqlite)

# Rails
Hecks.configure do |config|
  config.domain_path = Rails.root.join("app/domain")
end
```

See [Rails Integration](hecks_on_rails.md) and [SQL Adapter](sql_adapter.md).

---

## Adapters

Adapters wire real behavior into generated command ports.

```ruby
module MyAdapter
  def self.reset(command:, app:)
    app.event_bus.clear
  end
end

app.adapt("TestHelper", MyAdapter)
app.run("Reset")  # calls MyAdapter.reset
```

Built-in: `Hecks::Adapters::TestHelperAdapter`, `Hecks::Adapters::EventBusAdapter`.

---

## Example Generator

Generates a documented example app from domain IR. Comments come from `description` metadata.

```ruby
require "hecks/generators/docs/example_generator"

domain = Hecks::Chapters::Spec.definition
gen = Hecks::Generators::ExampleGenerator.new(domain, aggregates: ["Pizza", "Order"])
files = gen.generate
# => { "example.rb" => "...", "SpecBluebook" => "...", "SpecHecksagon" => "..." }
```

---

## Shorthand Syntax

Inside aggregate blocks, bare names become attributes and PascalCase names become value objects:

```ruby
aggregate "Pizza" do
  name String                    # attribute :name, String
  price Float                    # attribute :price, Float

  Topping do                     # value_object "Topping" do
    name String
    amount Integer
  end

  create do                      # command "CreatePizza" do
    name String
    price Float
  end
end
```

At domain level, PascalCase names with blocks become aggregates:

```ruby
Hecks.domain "Pizzas" do
  Pizza do
    attribute :name, String
  end
end
```
