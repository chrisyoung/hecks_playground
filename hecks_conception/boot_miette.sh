# Boot Miette — shell does the actual I/O work, then dispatches the
# boot.bluebook commands as journal entries so the domain records what
# happened. The bluebook is descriptive (what we did); the shell is
# effective (what actually moved bytes).
#
# Replaces the deleted hecks_life/src/boot.rs (commit e2896be6) which
# had the same responsibilities but was deleted under the assumption
# that the bluebook commands would do the work. They don't — they
# only emit events. This file restores the actual behaviors.
#
# Steps mirror the old boot.rs: hydrate, classify, discover, census,
# generate system_prompt, start mindstream, print vitals.
