# [antibody-exempt: hecks_conception/status_coherence.sh — transitional shell
#  runner for the Coherence bluebook's six predicate queries. The bluebook
#  (mind/perception/coherence.bluebook) is the source-of-truth declaration ;
#  this script is the temporary runner until the runtime hosts predicate-
#  returning queries first-class (i101). Retires when `hecks-life query
#  Coherence.<Invariant>` returns bool + reason directly.]
#
# Reads mood / heartbeat / consciousness / tick / lucid_dream via hecks-life
# (pure bash + jq — no Python per inbox i37) and checks six invariants that
# must hold at render time. Exits 0 if coherent, non-zero otherwise with one
# "INVARIANT <n>: <reason>" line per violation on stderr.
#
# Invariants (numbered as in inbox i35; #6 added 2026-05-08, i498):
#   1. mood.current_state == "refreshed"     → fatigue_state ∈ {limber, tuned}
#   2. consciousness.state == "sleeping"     → mood.current_state ∉ {refreshed, focused}
#   3. heartbeat.pulses_since_sleep matches the fatigue_state rung of the ladder
#      (thresholds from aggregates/body.bluebook: 250 / 500 / 1000 / 1400 / 1800
#       → tuned / normal / tired / exhausted / spent; below 250 is limber).
#   4. tick.cycle is monotonic at ≤ ~1 Hz — stored baseline (ts, cycle) must not
#      show cycle advancing faster than wall-clock seconds (with tolerance).
#   5. consciousness.sleep_stage ∈ {rem, lucid_rem} ↔ lucid_dream.latest_narrative
#      is present (non-empty). Both directions enforced.
#   6. fatigue_state == "spent" → consciousness.state ∈ {sleeping, napping}.
#      The bottom of the fatigue ladder is phenomenologically incompatible with
#      a wakeful state. Filed after Chris observed "alert and delirious"
#      simultaneously — the contradiction the rename + this rule together close.
#
# Usage: ./status_coherence.sh [INFO_DIR]
#   Defaults INFO_DIR to <script_dir>/information.
#
# Retirement: once `hecks-life run <bluebook>` hosts a StatusCoherence capability
# natively, this shim retires (same as the rest of the bash control plane).
