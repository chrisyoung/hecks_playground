# dream_content_smoke.sh — smoke test for the Dream PM (i220 / rem_branch retirement).
#
# [antibody-exempt: i220 retirement of rem_branch.sh — smoke now drives
#  the Dream PM via `hecks-life run-loop` instead of forking the legacy
#  shell. Mirrors the consolidate_smoke pattern (PR #592) ; retires
#  entirely when smoke tests port to a bluebook-shebang form.]
#
# Closes the rem_branch.sh retirement loop, alongside i220-1 (the
# cascade-LLM hook in `drain_policies` so PM-driven cascades reach
# the named-adapter pipeline) and the deferred i220-3 (FixtureLlmAdapter
# / HECKS_LLM_PROVIDER=test wiring for deterministic dream-content
# fixtures in this smoke). With those landed the Dream PM produces
# images declaratively from PM cascades through the runtime ; this
# smoke drives the PM directly via `hecks-life run-loop`.
#
# What this smoke verifies (today, post-i220-1) :
#
#   1. The Dream PM (body/dream/dream.bluebook) parses cleanly under
#      both Ruby + Rust loaders. The run-loop boot builds the Domain ;
#      if any DSL surface drifts, the boot fails.
#
#   2. The PM's lifecycle dispatches resolve to declared aggregates :
#        - DreamSeed.PlantSeed       (body/dream/dream_seed.bluebook ; sweep on Musing.recent)
#        - Dream.ProduceImage        (body/dream/dream.bluebook       ; per-tick image request)
#        - Body.RecordDreamPulse     (referenced by PM ; backed by Consciousness.DreamPulse today)
#
#   3. run-loop emits a synthetic SleepEntered (births the PM into
#      :incubating) + RemEntered (transitions to :generating) +
#      repeated PhaseElapsed (drives the per-tick generating loop).
#      The PM observes all three. We assert :
#        - PM-driven sweep enumerated Musing.recent into DreamSeed.PlantSeed
#          dispatches : dream_seed.heki has ≥1 record.
#        - PM-driven cascade dispatched Body.RecordDreamPulse per tick :
#          consciousness.dream_pulses incremented.
#
# What this smoke does NOT verify (scope-cut, named gaps) :
#
#   - text_fr / text_en content production. The Dream hecksagon's
#     `:dream_image` + `:dream_translate` adapters target
#     `Dream.RecordImage`, not `Dream.ProduceImage`. The PM today
#     dispatches `Dream.ProduceImage` only ; even with i220-1's
#     cascade-LLM hook in place, there's no adapter targeting
#     `Dream.ProduceImage` (gap i228 — chain-trigger-separate-from-
#     response-target). So the LLM doesn't fire from this PM cascade.
#     Closing that requires either (a) bluebook surgery to dispatch
#     `Dream.RecordImage` from the PM, (b) i228 (separate trigger
#     declaration), or (c) i220-3 (FixtureLlmAdapter wiring + dream
#     fixtures) — all deferred.
#
#   - lucid path. LucidDream.ObserveDream / SteerDream live on the
#     same chain-trigger gap and are also deferred.
#
# Exit 0 on pass, non-zero on fail.

# When the PM dispatches Dream.ProduceImage on PhaseElapsed, the

# response cascades into Dream.RecordImage(text_fr:). Verify the
# Dream singleton holds a non-empty text_fr after the run-loop drains.
#
# Lenient mode : an unknown prompt returns a synthetic
# `[test-provider:unknown-prompt sha256=...]` string. Either way,
# text_fr is non-empty after the cascade — that's what gap3 closes.
# A precise-content assertion lives in the rust llm_dispatcher_test
# integration tests (which use a fixture-keyed-by-known-SHA path).
# Dream aggregate lives in the BodyDream context (its bluebook
# declares `category "body"`). Heki paths reflect (context, name)
# pairing post-i142, so the singleton lands at
# `body_dream/dream.heki`, not `dream/dream.heki` (the latter is
# the PM persistence heki — same file basename, different role).
