# interpret_dream_smoke.sh — smoke test for interpret_dream.sh.
# [antibody-exempt: i37 Phase B sweep — replaces inline python3 -c with
#  native hecks-life heki subcommands per PR #272; retires when shell
#  wrapper ports to .bluebook shebang form (tracked in
#  terminal_capability_wiring plan).]
#
# Seeds dream_state.heki with known images, runs interpret_dream.sh
# against a tmpdir, and asserts that interpretation.heki + musing.heki
# grew. Real information/*.heki is never touched — the test sandboxes
# against a tmp copy via HECKS_INFO / HECKS_AGG.
#
# Assertions:
#   - dream_interpretation.heki carries a non-empty interpretation
#   - dream_interpretation.heki carries a recurring_theme
#   - musing.heki has ≥1 record sourced from dreams
#
# Exit 0 on pass, non-zero on fail.
