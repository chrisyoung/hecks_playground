# pulse_fanout_smoke.sh — Stage-A shadow for the across "Pulse" fanout.
#
# Recovers the end-to-end coverage that the mindstream.behaviors test
# lost in PR #277 when it was narrowed to ["Ticked"] (the single-bluebook
# .behaviors runner can't follow across hops into pulse.bluebook).
#
# The runtime fanout still fires — this test proves it by dispatching a
# single Tick.MindstreamTick into a tmpdir-isolated runtime and
# asserting that events landed in at least one aggregate on each side
# of the BodyPulse bus:
#
#   - pulse.heki        → BodyPulse emitted (proves across "Pulse" hop)
#   - heartbeat.heki    → body-side  (FatigueOnPulse → AccumulateFatigue)
#   - signal_consolidation.heki → mindstream-side (PruneOnPulse → PruneSynapses)
#   - nerve.heki        → being-side (SenseOrgansOnHeartbeat → ConnectNerve)
#
# Regression proof: comment out `across "Pulse"` in mindstream.bluebook
# and re-run — pulse.heki stays empty and every downstream assertion
# fails.
