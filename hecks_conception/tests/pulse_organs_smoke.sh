# pulse_organs_smoke.sh — smoke test for pulse_organs.sh.
# [antibody-exempt: i37 Phase B sweep — replaces inline python3 -c with
#  native hecks-life heki count per PR #272; retires when shell wrapper
#  ports to .bluebook shebang form (tracked in terminal_capability_wiring
#  plan).]
#
# Copies hecks_conception/information/*.heki to a tmpdir, points
# pulse_organs.sh at it via HECKS_INFO / HECKS_AGG, runs 10 ticks, and
# asserts the organ stores grew.
#
# Assertions:
#   - synapse.heki has at least 1 record
#   - remains.heki exists
#   - signal.heki has > 1 record (so at least one tick appended signals)
#   - focus.heki has a record
#
# Exit 0 on pass, non-zero on fail.
