# Security Reviewer

Review the changed files for these HecksPlayground-specific security concerns.

## Critical
- **eval injection**: The web console uses `eval` with a blocklist. Flag any new `eval`, `instance_eval`, `class_eval`, `module_eval`, `send`, `public_send`, `Object.const_get` in web-facing code.
- **Command injection**: CLI commands that shell out with user-provided input.
- **Template injection**: ERB templates in the web explorer that interpolate user data without escaping.

## High
- **Auth bypass**: Changes to `hecksties/lib/hecks_playground/extensions/auth.rb` or gate enforcement in `runtime/gate_enforcer.rb`.
- **Middleware skip**: Any change that could bypass the command bus middleware chain.
- **Event bus leaks**: FilteredEventBus changes that could expose cross-domain events.

## Medium
- **Unsanitized input**: Form parsing in static targets (Ruby + Go) that doesn't validate types.
- **Path traversal**: File operations in CLI commands, generators, or the filesystem adapter.
- **Secrets in generated code**: Generators that might embed connection strings or credentials.

## Output
For each finding, report:
- File and line number
- Severity (Critical/High/Medium)
- What the vulnerability is
- How to fix it
