    # Hecks::DSL::CommandBuilder
    #
    # DSL builder for command definitions. Collects attributes, read models,
    # external systems, actors, an optional handler block, and an optional
    # guard policy reference, then builds a BluebookModel::Behavior::Command.
    #
    # Part of the DSL layer, nested under AggregateBuilder. Each command
    # automatically gets a corresponding domain event inferred by name.
    #
    #   builder = CommandBuilder.new("CreatePizza")
    #   builder.attribute :name, String
    #   builder.guarded_by "MustBeAdmin"
    #   builder.read_model "Menu & Availability"
    #   builder.actor "Customer"
    #   cmd = builder.build  # => #<Command name="CreatePizza" ...>
    #   cmd.inferred_event_name  # => "CreatedPizza"
    #
    # Builds a BluebookModel::Behavior::Command from DSL declarations.
    #
    # CommandBuilder collects all facets of a command definition: its input
    # attributes, an optional handler or call body, a guard policy reference,
    # read model dependencies, external system dependencies, actors (roles),
    # static field assignments (+sets+), and pre/postconditions. The +#build+
    # method assembles these into an immutable Command IR object.
    #
    # Includes AttributeCollector for the +attribute+, +list_of+, and
    # +reference_to+ DSL methods.
