# = BlueBook
#
# The domain command language for Hecks. Named for Evans' DDD Blue Book
# and Smalltalk's Blue Book — the two traditions this grammar descends from.
#
# Loaded from its own Bluebook chapter — the chapter lists every aggregate,
# and load_aggregates derives the require tree from naming conventions.
# The Bluebook IS the Bluebook.
#
#   ast = BlueBook::Grammar.parse("Pizza.attr :name, String")
#

# Bootstrap: Tokenizer, IR, DSL kernel — the minimum to run BluebookBuilder.
# These must load before any chapter can describe aggregates, so they
# cannot use chapter-driven loading. They define the types and builders
# that BluebookBuilder.new("tmp") needs inside every chapter .define method.
