    # Hecks::BluebookModel::Behavior::Command
    #
    # Intermediate representation of a domain command -- an intent to change state.
    # Each command carries attributes, optional read models, external systems,
    # and actors. Can infer a corresponding event name by converting the verb
    # to past tense (CreatePizza -> CreatedPizza), or can have explicit event
    # name(s) declared via the +emits+ DSL keyword.
    #
    # Part of the BluebookModel IR layer. Built by CommandBuilder or EventStorm
    # parser, consumed by CommandGenerator and event inference in AggregateBuilder.
    #
