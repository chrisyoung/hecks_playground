    # Hecks::BluebookModel::Behavior::Policy
    #
    # Intermediate representation of a domain policy. Policies come in two forms:
    #
    # 1. *Reactive policies* trigger a command in response to an event (cross-context
    #    communication). They listen for a named event and dispatch a command when
    #    fired. An optional +condition+ block can gate whether the policy fires,
    #    and an +attribute_map+ can transform event data into command attributes.
    #    The +defaults+ hash provides fallback values for command attributes not
    #    present on the event.
    #
    # 2. *Guard policies* carry a block that validates a command before execution.
    #    If the block returns falsy, the command is rejected.
    #
    # Part of the BluebookModel IR layer. Built by PolicyBuilder (reactive) or
    # AggregateBuilder (guard), consumed by generators and the Application layer.
    # Use {#reactive?} and {#guard?} to distinguish the two forms.
    #
    #   # Reactive policy: event -> command (conditional)
    #   policy = Policy.new(name: "FraudAlert", event_name: "Withdrew",
    #                       trigger_command: "FlagSuspicious",
    #                       condition: ->(event) { event.amount > 10_000 })
    #   policy.reactive?   # => true
    #   policy.condition   # => #<Proc ...>
    #
    #   # Guard policy: block validates a command
    #   guard = Policy.new(name: "MustBeAdmin", block: ->(cmd) { cmd.role == "admin" })
    #   guard.guard?      # => true
    #   guard.reactive?   # => false
