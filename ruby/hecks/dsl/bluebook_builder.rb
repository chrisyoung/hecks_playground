    #
    # Top-level DSL builder for domain definitions. Collects aggregate definitions
    # and domain-level policies, then builds a BluebookModel::Structure::Domain.
    # Enforces unique aggregate names. Domain-level policies are cross-aggregate
    # reactive policies defined outside any aggregate block.

    #     aggregate "Loan" do ... end

    # BluebookBuilder is the entry point for defining an entire domain model. It
    # collects aggregate definitions, cross-aggregate reactive policies, domain
    # services, read model views, workflows, event subscribers, and tenancy
    # configuration. The +#build+ method assembles these into an immutable
    # Domain IR (intermediate representation) object.
    #
    # Aggregates names must be unique within a domain; attempting to define
    # a duplicate raises +ArgumentError+. Errors within aggregate blocks are
    # wrapped in +Hecks::ValidationError+ with context about which aggregate
    # failed.
