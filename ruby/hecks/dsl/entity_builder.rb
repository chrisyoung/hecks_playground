    # Hecks::DSL::EntityBuilder
    #
    # DSL builder for sub-entity definitions within aggregates. Collects attributes
    # and invariants, then builds a BluebookModel::Structure::Entity. Entities have
    # identity (UUID), are mutable, and use identity-based equality.
    #
    # Part of the DSL layer, nested under AggregateBuilder. The resulting entity
    # is embedded within its parent aggregate.
    #
    #   builder = EntityBuilder.new("LedgerEntry")
    #   builder.attribute :amount, Float
    #   builder.attribute :description, String
    #   builder.invariant("amount positive") { amount > 0 }
    #   entity = builder.build  # => #<Entity name="LedgerEntry" ...>
    #
    # Builds a BluebookModel::Structure::Entity from DSL declarations.
    #
    # EntityBuilder collects attributes and invariants for a sub-entity that
    # lives within an aggregate boundary. Unlike value objects, entities have
    # their own identity (a UUID assigned at creation) and use identity-based
    # equality. They are mutable and can be independently referenced within
    # their parent aggregate.
    #
    # Includes AttributeCollector for the +attribute+, +list_of+, and
    # +reference_to+ DSL methods.
