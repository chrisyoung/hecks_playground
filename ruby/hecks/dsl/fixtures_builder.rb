# Hecks::DSL::FixturesBuilder
#
# DSL entry point for `Hecks.fixtures "Pizzas" do ... end` — the
# standalone fixtures file format. Sibling to BluebookBuilder and
# TestSuiteBuilder: its own file extension (.fixtures), its own
# surface, its own parity contract with the Rust parser.
#
# Surface (kept small):
#
#   Hecks.fixtures "Pizzas" do
#     aggregate "Pizza" do
#       fixture "Margherita", name: "Margherita", description: "Classic"
#       fixture "Pepperoni",  name: "Pepperoni",  description: "Spicy"
#     end
#     aggregate "Order" do
#       fixture "PendingOrder", customer_name: "Sample", quantity: 1
#     end
#   end
#
# Produces `Structure::FixturesFile` — a domain-name + list of
# `Structure::Fixture` records that match what the bluebook's inline
# form used to produce. Downstream consumers (heki seed loader,
# behavioral test setups) see the same shape; only the source file
# changed.
