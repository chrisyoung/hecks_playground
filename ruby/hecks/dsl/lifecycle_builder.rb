    # Hecks::DSL::LifecycleBuilder
    #
    # DSL builder for state machine declarations on aggregates. Collects
    # command-to-state transitions and builds a Lifecycle IR object.
    #
    #   builder = LifecycleBuilder.new(:status, default: "draft")
    #   builder.transition "ApproveModel" => "approved"
    #   builder.transition "SuspendModel" => "suspended"
    #   lifecycle = builder.build
    #
    # Builds a BluebookModel::Structure::Lifecycle from transition declarations.
    #
    # LifecycleBuilder defines a state machine on a single aggregate field.
    # Each transition maps a command name to a target state, with an optional
    # +:from+ constraint that restricts which source states are valid. The
    # runtime enforces these transitions at command dispatch time.
    #
    # Used inside +AggregateBuilder#lifecycle+ blocks.
