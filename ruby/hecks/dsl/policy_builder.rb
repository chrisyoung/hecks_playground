    # Hecks::DSL::PolicyBuilder
    #
    # DSL builder for reactive policy definitions. Binds an event name to a
    # trigger command, creating the wiring for event-driven workflows. Supports
    # an optional `condition` block that gates when the policy fires.
    #
    # Part of the DSL layer, nested under AggregateBuilder. Policies enable
    # cross-context communication by reacting to events from any context.
    #
    #   builder = PolicyBuilder.new("FraudAlert")
    #   builder.on "Withdrew"
    #   builder.trigger "FlagSuspicious"
    #   builder.condition { |event| event.amount > 10_000 }
    #   policy = builder.build  # => #<Policy name="FraudAlert" condition=... ...>
    #
    # Builds a BluebookModel::Behavior::Policy from reactive policy declarations.
    #
    # PolicyBuilder wires domain events to command triggers, forming the backbone
    # of event-driven cross-aggregate workflows. Each policy listens for a
    # specific event (+on+), dispatches a command (+trigger+) in response, and
    # optionally:
    # - Maps event attributes to command attributes (+map+)
    # - Injects static default values (+defaults+)
    # - Gates firing on a condition block (+condition+)
    # - Runs asynchronously (+async+)
    #
    # The +#build+ method validates that both +on+ and +trigger+ have been
    # called, raising descriptive errors if either is missing.
