    # Hecks::DSL::ReadModelBuilder
    #
    # DSL builder for read model definitions. Collects event projections
    # and builds a BluebookModel::Behavior::ReadModel. Each projection maps
    # an event name to a proc that transforms state.
    #
    #   builder = ReadModelBuilder.new("OrderSummary")
    #   builder.project("PlacedOrder") { |event, state| state.merge(total: event.quantity) }
    #   rm = builder.build  # => #<ReadModel name="OrderSummary" ...>
    #
    # Builds a BluebookModel::Behavior::ReadModel from projection declarations.
    #
    # ReadModelBuilder defines a denormalized read-side view that is built by
    # applying projection functions to domain events. Each projection maps an
    # event name to a block that receives the event and current state, returning
    # the updated state. Multiple projections can be defined for different events.
    #
    # Read models are defined at the domain level via +BluebookBuilder#view+ and
    # provide optimized query paths separate from the write-side aggregates.
