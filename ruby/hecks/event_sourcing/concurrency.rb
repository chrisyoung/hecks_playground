# Hecks::EventSourcing::Concurrency
#
# Optimistic concurrency control for event-sourced aggregates. Mixes a
# `_version` field onto aggregate instances and enforces version checks
# before persisting. Raises ConcurrencyError when the stored version has
# moved past the expected version, preventing lost-update anomalies.
#
# == Usage
#
#   Concurrency.stamp!(aggregate, 3)
#   aggregate._version  # => 3
#
#   Concurrency.check!(expected: 2, actual: 3)
#   # => raises Hecks::ConcurrencyError
