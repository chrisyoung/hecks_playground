  # HecksTenancy::OwnershipScopedRepository
  #
  # Repository proxy that enforces row-level ownership. Wraps an inner
  # repository instance and restricts find/all/delete to records whose
  # ownership field matches the current identity (from +identity_source+).
  #
  # Used by the Hecks runtime when a gate declares +owned_by :field+.
  # Also used for +:row+ tenancy strategy (identity_source reads +Hecks.tenant+).

  #   Hecks.current_user = "alice"
  #   repo.all           # => only alice's records
  #   repo.find(other_id) # => raises Hecks::GateAccessDenied
