    # Hecks::Generators::Domain::ViewGenerator
    #
    # Generates CQRS view (read model) classes that subscribe to domain events
    # and maintain projected state. Views are namespaced under +Domain::Views+.
    #
    # Each view class includes:
    # - A +PROJECTIONS+ constant listing the event names it handles
    # - A +call(event, state)+ method that dispatches to the appropriate
    #   +project_<event_name>+ method based on the event's class name
    # - Individual +project_<event_name>+ methods whose bodies come from
    #   the DSL projection blocks
    #
    # The +call+ method uses the event's class name (underscore-cased) to find
    # the matching projection method. If no projection handles the event, the
    # current state is returned unchanged.
    #
    # Part of Generators::Domain.
    #
    # == Usage
    #
    #   gen = ViewGenerator.new(view, domain_module: "ComplianceDomain")
    #   gen.generate
    #
    class ViewGenerator < Hecks::Generator

      # Initializes the view generator.
      #
      # @param view [Object] the view model object; provides +name+ and +projections+
      #   (a Hash or array of hashes mapping event names to projection blocks)
      # @param domain_module [String] the Ruby module name to wrap the generated class in
      def initialize(view, domain_module:)
        @view = view
        @domain_module = domain_module
      end

      # Generates the full Ruby source code for the view class.
      #
      # Produces a class under +Domain::Views+ with a +PROJECTIONS+ constant,
      # a +call+ dispatcher method, and individual +project_<event>+ methods
      # for each projection.
      #
      # @return [String] the generated Ruby source code, newline-terminated
