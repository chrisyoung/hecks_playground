  # Hecks::Command
  #
  # Mixin for generated command classes. Orchestrates the full command lifecycle:
  # run guard policy, run handler, execute call (with optional middleware),
  # persist aggregate, emit event, and record event.
  # The generated call method is pure domain logic — just build and return
  # the aggregate.
  #
  # == Lifecycle
  #
  # When +.call+ is invoked the following steps execute in order:
  # 1. Guard policy (+guarded_by+) -- rejects unauthorized commands
  # 2. Handler callback (+handler+) -- optional pre-processing hook
  # 3. Precondition checks -- domain invariants that must hold before execution
  # 4. +#call+ (user-defined) -- builds/modifies the aggregate; may be wrapped by command bus middleware
  # 5. Postcondition checks -- domain invariants that must hold after execution
  # 6. Persist aggregate via the wired repository
  # 7. Emit event via the wired event bus
  # 8. Record event in the event recorder for the aggregate
  #
  # == Chaining
  #
  # Commands can be chained fluently with +#then+. If any step raises, the
  # chain short-circuits and the error is captured on the originating command.
  #
  # == Usage
  #
  #   class CreatePizza
  #     emits "CreatedPizza"
  #
  #     def call
  #       Pizza.new(name: name)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   cmd = CreatePizza.call(name: "Margherita")
  #   cmd.aggregate  # => #<Pizza>
  #   cmd.event      # => #<CreatedPizza>
