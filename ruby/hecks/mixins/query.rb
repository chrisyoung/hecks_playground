  # Hecks::Query
  #
  # Mixin for generated query classes. Provides repository wiring and
  # delegates query methods (where, order, limit, etc.) to a QueryBuilder.
  # The generated call method is pure domain logic -- describes the query.
  #
  # == How it works
  #
  # When +.call+ is invoked, a new query instance is created and a +QueryBuilder+
  # is initialized against the wired repository. The user-defined +#call+ method
  # uses DSL methods (+where+, +order+, +limit+, +offset+) to build the query.
  # The resulting +QueryBuilder+ is chainable and lazily evaluated.
  #
  # == Comparison operators
  #
  # For range and inequality queries, use the operator helpers inside +#call+:
  # +gt+, +gte+, +lt+, +lte+, +not_eq+, +one_of+. These return operator
  # objects that the QueryBuilder interprets.
  #
  # == Usage
  #
  #   class Classics
  #     include Hecks::Query
  #
  #     def call
  #       where(style: "Classic").order(:name)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   Classics.call          # => QueryBuilder (chainable)
  #   Classics.call.to_a     # => [#<Pizza>, ...]
