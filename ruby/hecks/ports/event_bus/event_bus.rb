  # Hecks::EventBus
  #
  # Simple in-process publish/subscribe event bus. Stores all published events
  # in an ordered log and notifies registered listeners by event class name.
  #
  # Supports two subscription modes:
  # - Named subscriptions via +subscribe(event_name)+ for specific event types
  # - Global subscriptions via +on_any+ for receiving every published event
  #
  # Part of the Ports layer. Used by the command runner and policy system to
  # decouple command execution from event handling and cross-cutting concerns.
  #
  # == Usage
  #
  #   bus = EventBus.new
  #   bus.subscribe("CreatedPizza") { |event| puts event.name }
  #   bus.on_any { |event| log(event) }
  #   bus.publish(pizza_created_event)
  #   bus.events  # => [#<CreatedPizza ...>]
  #   bus.clear   # empties the event log
  #
