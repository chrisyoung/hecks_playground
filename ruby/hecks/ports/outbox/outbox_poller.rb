# Hecks::Outbox::OutboxPoller
#
# Synchronous poller that reads unpublished entries from the outbox and
# publishes them to the event bus. After successful publication, each entry
# is marked as published so it will not be delivered again.
#
# In the memory adapter this runs synchronously in the same process.
# Production adapters can run the poller in a background thread or
# separate process against a shared database outbox table.
#
# Accepts an optional +publisher+ callable. When the event bus's publish
# method has been wrapped (e.g., to redirect into the outbox), the publisher
# bypasses the wrapper and delivers events to the original listeners.
#
# == Usage
#
#   poller = Hecks::Outbox::OutboxPoller.new(outbox, event_bus)
#   poller.drain    # publishes all pending entries
#   poller.stats    # => { published: 3, pending: 0 }
