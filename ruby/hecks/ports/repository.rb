  # Hecks::Persistence
  #
  # The top-level module for all persistence-related concerns in the Hecks framework.
  # Groups CRUD repository methods, collection proxies for list attributes,
  # reference resolution for cross-aggregate lookups, and optional event sourcing
  # via EventRecorder.
  #
  # This module acts as the wiring layer between domain aggregate classes and their
  # underlying storage. It is called during application boot to attach persistence
  # behavior to each aggregate class without polluting the domain model itself.
  #
  # == Usage
  #
  #   Persistence.bind(PizzaClass, pizza_aggregate, repo)
  #   # Now PizzaClass has .create, .find, .all, #save, #update, #destroy, etc.
  #
  #   Persistence.bind_event_recorder(PizzaClass, recorder)
  #   # Now PizzaClass.history(id) returns event history
  #
  # == Submodules
  #
  # - +RepositoryMethods+ -- CRUD class/instance methods (find, create, save, update, destroy)
  # - +CollectionMethods+ -- Accessor methods for list attributes returning CollectionProxy
  # - +CollectionProxy+   -- Persistence-aware wrapper around list attributes
  # - +CollectionItem+    -- Delegator wrapper for individual items in a collection
  # - +ReferenceMethods+  -- Resolves reference_to attributes into aggregate lookups
  # - +EventRecorder+     -- SQL-backed event store for event-sourced aggregates
