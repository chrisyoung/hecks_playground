    # Advisory warning for aggregates that have exactly one attribute and no
    # value objects or entities. A single-attribute aggregate with no composition
    # is often better modeled as a value object inside another aggregate.

    # Part of the ValidationRules::Structure group -- run by +Hecks.validate+.
    #
    # Example trigger:
    #   aggregate "Color" do
    #     attribute :hex, String
    #     command "CreateColor" do attribute :hex, String end
    #   end
    #
    # Would warn: "Color has only 1 attribute and no value objects or entities --
    #   consider modeling as a value object"
