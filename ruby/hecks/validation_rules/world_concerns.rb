    # Hecks::ValidationRules::WorldConcerns
    #
    # Validation rules activated by the +world_concerns+ DSL keyword. Each rule
    # checks a specific ethical or governance concern (transparency, consent,
    # privacy, security) and only fires when its concern is declared on the domain.
    #
    # Rules are autoloaded and self-register via +Hecks.register_validation_rule+.
