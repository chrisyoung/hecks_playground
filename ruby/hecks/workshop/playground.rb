    # Hecks::Workshop::Playground
    #
    # Live execution sandbox that compiles a domain model into real Ruby classes,
    # boots a full Runtime with memory adapters, and lets you execute commands
    # with real persistence. Used by Session's "play" mode for rapid prototyping.
    #
    # Generates a temp gem, loads it, then creates a Runtime that wires
    # persistence, commands, queries, and the event bus. Aggregates are
    # persisted in memory -- find, all, count, where all work.
    #
    # The Playground intercepts the event bus's +publish+ method to capture every
    # emitted event into an internal list for inspection via +events+, +events_of+,
    # and +history+.
    #
    # Mixins:
    #   GemBootstrap    -- temp gem compilation and loading (compile!)
    #   RuntimeResolver -- command/event class resolution and policy checking
    #
    #   playground = Hecks::Workshop::Playground.new(domain)

    #   Pizza.find(id)         # works -- persisted in memory
    #   Pizza.all              # works
    #   playground.events      # => [#<CreatedPizza ...>]
    #   playground.reset!      # clears events and repositories
