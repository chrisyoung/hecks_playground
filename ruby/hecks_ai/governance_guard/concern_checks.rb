# Hecks::GovernanceGuard::ConcernChecks
#
# Rule-based governance checks for each world concern. These checks
# mirror the validation rules in bluebook but provide richer suggestions
# and work at the governance level (violations + suggestions) rather
# than the validation level (errors only).
#
# Each check method returns [violations, suggestions] arrays.
#
#   checks = ConcernChecks.new(domain)
#   violations, suggestions = checks.check_transparency
