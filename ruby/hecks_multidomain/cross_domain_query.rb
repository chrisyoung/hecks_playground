  # Hecks::CrossDomainQuery
  #
  # A read-only query that spans multiple bounded contexts. Registered at
  # the application level via +Hecks.cross_domain_query+, it resolves
  # aggregate classes from any booted domain using the +from+ helper.
  #
  # Cross-domain queries are the only sanctioned way to read data across
  # bounded context boundaries. They enforce read-only access -- mutations
  # must go through the owning domain's command bus.
  #
  # == Registration
  #
  #   Hecks.cross_domain_query "ComplianceCheck" do |model_id:|
  #     model   = from("ModelRegistry", "AiModel").find(model_id)
  #     reviews = from("Compliance", "ComplianceReview").by_model(model_id)
  #     { model: model, reviews: reviews }
  #   end
  #
  # == Execution
  #
  #   result = Hecks.query("ComplianceCheck", model_id: "abc")
  #   # => { model: #<AiModel>, reviews: [#<ComplianceReview>, ...] }
