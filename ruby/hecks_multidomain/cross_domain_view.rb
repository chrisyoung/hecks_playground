  # Hecks::CrossDomainView
  #
  # An event-driven read model that projects events from multiple bounded
  # contexts into a single in-memory state. Subscribes to the shared event
  # bus and applies projection functions as events arrive.
  #
  # Each projection is a named function that receives the event and the current
  # state, and returns the new state. State is accumulated as a Hash that grows
  # as events are processed. The view can be reset to its initial empty state.
  #
  # == Lifecycle
  #
  # 1. Create the view with projections via a DSL block
  # 2. Subscribe it to an event bus (typically the shared cross-domain bus)
  # 3. As events are published, projections update the state
  # 4. Query +state+ at any time for the current read model
  #
  # == Usage
  #
  #   view = Hecks.cross_domain_view "RiskDashboard" do
  #     project("RegisteredModel") { |e, s| s.merge(total: (s[:total] || 0) + 1) }
  #     project("ReportedIncident") { |e, s| s.merge(incidents: (s[:incidents] || 0) + 1) }
  #   end
  #
  #   view.state  # => { total: 5, incidents: 2 }
  #   view.reset  # => clears state back to {}
