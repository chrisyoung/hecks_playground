module Hecks
  module MultiDomain
    # Builds a directionality map by introspecting reactive policies across
    # multiple domains. A reactive policy is one that reacts to an event from
    # another domain (e.g., +on PizzaOrdered, trigger: ReserveIngredients+).
    #
    # The directionality map tells each domain which other domains' events it
    # needs to receive. This is used by +boot_multi+ to create +FilteredEventBus+
    # instances that restrict event flow to only the declared directions.
    #
    # Also provides a +.validate+ method that compares introspected directionality
    # against explicit +listens_to+ declarations, returning warnings for any
    # mismatches where a policy needs events that are not declared.
    module Directionality
      # Build a map of gem_name -> array of source gem_names this domain
      # needs events from, based on reactive policy introspection.
      #
      # Algorithm:
      # 1. Collect all events across all domains, mapping event name to the
      #    gem_name of the domain that defines it (+event_origins+).
      # 2. For each domain, inspect all reactive policies (both aggregate-level
      #    and domain-level). If a policy reacts to an event from a different
      #    domain, record that domain as a listener of the event's source.
      #
      # @param domains [Array<Hecks::BluebookModel::Structure::Domain>] all domains in the multi-domain setup
      # @return [Hash<String, Array<String>>] map of gem_name to array of source gem_names
      #   it needs to listen to. Only domains with cross-domain reactive policies appear as keys.
