  # Hecks::FilteredEventBus
  #
  # Decorator around EventBus that enforces cross-domain event directionality.
  # Tags outgoing events with the publishing domain's +gem_name+, and filters
  # incoming events so only declared sources are received.
  #
  # When +allowed_sources+ is nil, all events pass through (open bus / backward-
  # compatible mode). When set, only events from those source domains (or events
  # with no source tag) are delivered to handlers.
  #
  # == How it works
  #
  # - +publish+ sets a +@_source_domain+ instance variable on the event before
  #   delegating to the inner bus. This tags the event with its origin domain.
  # - +subscribe+ and +on_any+ wrap handler blocks to check the source tag
  #   against the allowed sources list before invoking the original handler.
  #
  # == Usage
  #
  #   bus = FilteredEventBus.new(
  #     inner: shared_bus,
  #     domain_gem_name: "orders_domain",
  #     allowed_sources: ["inventory_domain"]
  #   )
  #   bus.publish(event)     # tags event with source "orders_domain"
  #   bus.subscribe("Foo") { |e| ... }  # only fires for events from inventory_domain
  #
