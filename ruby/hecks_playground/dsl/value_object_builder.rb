    # HecksPlayground::DSL::ValueObjectBuilder
    #
    # DSL builder for value object definitions. Collects attributes and invariants,
    # then builds a BluebookModel::Structure::ValueObject. Used inside aggregate blocks.
    #
    # Part of the DSL layer, nested under AggregateBuilder. The resulting value
    # object is embedded within its parent aggregate.
    #
    #   builder = ValueObjectBuilder.new("Address")
    #   builder.attribute :street, String
    #   builder.attribute :city, String
    #   builder.invariant("street required") { !street.nil? }
    #   vo = builder.build  # => #<ValueObject name="Address" ...>
    #
    # Builds a BluebookModel::Structure::ValueObject from DSL declarations.
    #
    # ValueObjectBuilder collects attributes and invariants for an immutable,
    # equality-by-value type embedded within an aggregate. Value objects have
    # no identity of their own -- two value objects with the same attribute
    # values are considered equal. They are always immutable; changes produce
    # new instances.

    # +reference_to+ DSL methods.
