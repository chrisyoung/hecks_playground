      # Each concern is extracted into its own submodule:
      #   EventRoutes     — event listing and JSON endpoints
      #   RouteDispatcher — URL dispatch, search parsing, CSRF validation
      #   IndexRoute      — aggregate index with search and filtering
      #   ShowRoute       — aggregate detail page
      #   FormRoute       — command form rendering and submission
