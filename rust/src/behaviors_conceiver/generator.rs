//! Generator for behavioral test suites
//!
//! Walks a source domain's IR and emits one starter test per command
//! plus one per query. Smart enough that the auto-generated suite
//! mostly *passes* against the in-memory runner — the user iterates
//! from there.
//!
//! How each test is composed:
//!
//! * **Setups.** If the command has a self-ref (a reference whose
//!   target matches its own aggregate), a setup creates the entity
//!   first using the aggregate's first Create-style command. If the
//!   command has cross-refs (references to other aggregates),
//!   setups create those entities first too. The runtime auto-assigns
//!   IDs starting at "1" sequentially, so the setup→input chain works
//!   without naming.
//!
//! * **Input.** Self-ref id (always "1" because we just created it),
//!   cross-ref ids ("1" each), then the command's declared attributes
//!   with sample values per type.
//!
//! * **Expect.** Three sources, merged:
//!     1. For Create-style commands: the command attrs that ALSO appear
//!        as aggregate attrs (the runtime auto-bootstraps these).
//!     2. Each `then_set :field, to: <val>` mutation contributes
//!        `field: <val>`. Each append mutation contributes
//!        `field_size: 1`.
//!     3. If the command appears in a lifecycle transition:
//!        `<lifecycle.field>: <to_state>`.
//!
//! Refused-variant tests for given clauses are NOT auto-generated —
//! they need domain knowledge of what setup makes the given fail.
//! Hand-write those.
