//! Framework substrate — the kernel's own aggregates, and how it reaches them.
//!
//! [antibody-exempt: rust/src/runtime/framework_substrate.rs — kernel-floor
//!  runtime, extracted verbatim from runtime/mod.rs (which carries the same
//!  marker). The collaborator that holds the runtime's OWN aggregates cannot
//!  itself be a bluebook : it is the mechanism by which bluebook substrate is
//!  reached at all.]
//!
//! The runtime must write aggregates the USER's domain does not own : the event
//! Log (`EventSourcing::Event`), the veto audit (`Governance::Violation`) and
//! the event-out outbox (`OutboundEvent`). It used to ask "is that aggregate in
//! MY domain?" and silently do nothing when it wasn't — a minimal boot wrote no
//! Log and lost authorization audit rows — while a graft spliced the outbox into
//! any domain with an effect port to paper over the third.
//!
//! The answer is a COLLABORATOR : a second Runtime booted on crate-owned
//! substrate that the kernel dispatches into. This module owns it — the embedded
//! bluebooks, the merged framework domain, the declared store location, the lazy
//! accessor, the inspection surface, and the DOOR-side lookup an out-of-process
//! caller needs.
//!
//! `CascadeRun` deliberately does NOT live here : its guard selects between two
//! WORKING paths (persistent outbox vs the in-memory pump), not between working
//! and losing data. See `inbox/CARD-framework-substrate-service.md`.
//!
//! Inherent `impl Runtime` methods in a child module, reaching Runtime's private
//! fields through child-module privacy and the `super::*` glob — the same shape
//! `query.rs` and `reaction.rs` use.
