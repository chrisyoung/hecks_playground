//! command_role_gate_test.rs — a command's declared `role` ENFORCES.
//!
//! The reported bug : a user switched the UI to "Customer" and ran `CheckOut`
//! (a `role "System"` command) — and it went through. The word `role` in the
//! model meant nothing at runtime. This test pins the reconciliation locked with
//! the owner : the command's declared `role` (the DDD / EventStorming actor) is
//! the ENFORCED DEFAULT — a caller acting AS a different role is refused, UNLESS
//! an explicit Authorization Policy permits ; an explicit `Forbid` still wins.
//! So `role` is BOTH the ubiquitous-language persona AND a deny-by-default gate,
//! and the decoupled Cedar-shaped PDP keeps its override job.
//!
//! Tested against the REAL ToolShed demo (examples/workshop_demo/toolshed.bluebook
//! — the domain the bug was found in), composed with the shipped GATING
//! (storehouse.bluebook) and AUTHZ (authorization.bluebook) contexts, exactly as
//! a served deployment composes them. Assertions isolate the GATE by keying on
//! `RuntimeError::Unauthorized` vs anything-else : a gate-passing command may
//! still fail ToolShed's own payload rules, which is NOT a denial.
