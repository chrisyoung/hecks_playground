      # CHAPTERS FIRST, JUDGED ONCE, THEN EVERYTHING THAT READS THEM.
      # A chapter may be split across files (the language's own grammar is
      # nine), and judging file one before files two-through-nine exist
      # refuses references that are perfectly well declared a file later —
      # see MetaValidator.defer for the whole reasoning. DOMAIN_ORDER
      # already places every `*.bluebook` ahead of hecksagons and worlds,
      # so the window ends at the last chapter pattern rather than at a
      # hand-written list this would otherwise have to keep in step.
      #
      # `environment:` — ONE MORE FILE, LOADED LAST, NOT A GLOB. A caller
      # passing `Hecks.boot(path, environment: "production")` gets exactly
      # `environments/production.hecksagon` loaded (if it exists — a
      # missing one is a silent no-op, not every environment needs an
      # override; see this file's own README/wiring docs for the
      # motivating case: swapping a driven adapter — e.g. a real payment
      # gateway for a mock one — without an `if`/`else` anywhere in the
      # domain's own wiring). Never matched by `DOMAIN_ORDER`'s own globs
      # (all non-recursive, none named `environments/*`), so this is the
      # only thing that ever reaches it. Loaded as a genuine
      # `Hecks.hecksagon "SameDomain" do ... end` block — merges into the
      # base file's own hecksagon via `Registry#add_hecksagon`
      # (concatenates binds, doesn't overwrite), so it can rebind
      # anything the base file bound without needing to know what else
      # the base file declared.

      # THE DOMAIN YOU ARE STANDING IN. Walks up from `from` — the way git
      # finds `.git` — and answers the nearest directory a boot would accept,
      # or nil if there is not one above you.
      #
      # MARKED BY A `.hecksagon`, NOT BY A `.bluebook`. Chapters are
      # everywhere: era translations, the language's own self-hosted grammar,
      # and `spec/fixtures`, which holds a dozen unrelated ones in a single
      # directory. A `.hecksagon` is the file that says "this is a domain, and
      # here is how its aggregates are stored", which is exactly the claim a
      # caller is relying on when they omit the path.
      #
      # Both layouts, because `bluebook_directory` above accepts both: a
      # domain directory holding a `bluebook/` subdirectory (every example in
      # this corpus), or one holding the files directly.
      # NORMALISED TO THE OUTER DIRECTORY. Standing in `examples/banking/bluebook`,
      # the `.hecksagon` is right there, so a plain walk stops on the
      # `bluebook/` directory itself. Both boot identically — `bluebook_directory`
      # accepts either and `Loader.boot` takes `File.dirname` of what it gets,
      # so the registry root comes out the same — but `examples/banking` is the
      # directory a person names, and the one a `.world`'s `dir "data"` reads
      # as relative to.
