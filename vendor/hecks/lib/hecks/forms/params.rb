    # The two directions between a flat, dotted, ALL-STRINGS web payload
    # (`{"amount.cents"=>"1050", "amount.currency"=>"USD"}`, whether it came
    # off a POST form body or a GET query string — Rack hands back the same
    # flat shape for both as long as nothing uses `[]` bracket names) and the
    # nested, typed hash `Dispatcher#dispatch`/`#query` actually take
    # (`{amount: {cents: 1050, currency: "USD"}}`).
    #
    # `extract` NEEDS the Field tree, not just the raw params — a numeric
    # leaf's own runtime check (`Value::Coercion#check_numeric_fields`)
    # requires an actual `Integer`/`Float`, not a String that merely looks
    # like one (`given.is_a?(expected)`, no coercion attempted there); a web
    # form can only ever hand back strings, so the cast has to happen here,
    # once, using the SAME shape `FieldShape` already resolved for
    # rendering the input in the first place — one reading of the IR, not
    # two that could disagree.

      # Every LEAF field carries its own full dotted path regardless of how
      # deep `FieldShape` nested it to get there — a single-attribute value
      # object unwraps to a leaf sitting at the TOP of the fields array with
      # a two-segment path (`"reference.value"`), the exact same shape a
      # `:group`'s own child carries. So this collects every leaf as
      # (full path -> value) FIRST, and nests by the path's OWN segments
      # last — one nesting rule, blind to how a field arrived at its path.
