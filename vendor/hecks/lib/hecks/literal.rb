  # THE ONE SPELLING FOR A CAPTURED RUBY LITERAL ON THE WIRE.
  #
  # Several `to_h` fields hold a value the author wrote in a bluebook —
  # `where(status: { eq: "open" })`, `then_set append: { direction: { value:
  # "credit" } }`, `dispatch ... with: { number: :source }`, an attribute's
  # `default:` — as TEXT, because the export has to stand on its own and a
  # String field cannot say "this one was a Symbol". Every such field is the
  # same question and now gets the same answer.
  #
  # It was three answers before, and they disagreed on both axes that matter.
  # `Mutation#appended_fields` spelled a Symbol BARE and everything else
  # `inspect`; `QuerySpecification.render_value` spelled a Symbol with a COLON
  # and everything else `to_s`. So `:amount` crossed as "amount" in a mutation
  # and ":amount" in a saga binding — the same value, two spellings, and each
  # reader had to know which field it was looking at. Worse, `to_s`/`inspect`
  # on a Hash is Ruby's OWN rendering, which moved under us: 3.3 writes
  # `{:value=>"credit"}` and 3.4 writes `{value: "credit"}` for the identical
  # Hash, so the wire format was silently pinned to an interpreter version.
  #
  # SELF-DESCRIBING IS THE RULE, stated once here rather than inherited from
  # whatever `inspect` happens to do: a symbol wears its colon, a string wears
  # its quotes, a hash wears `{key: value}` braces, a list wears its brackets,
  # and a number, a boolean and nil are bare. `read` is the exact inverse, and
  # is the only thing that should ever take one of these strings apart.
