    # `admits:`/`pattern:` (`attribute_collector.rb`'s own keyword args) sit
    # on the SAME `IR::Attribute` shape wherever `attribute()` is called —
    # a value object's own field (`EmailAddress.address, pattern: ...`) or
    # an aggregate/command's own usage-level attribute (`ExternalTransfer`'s
    # `direction, MovementDirection, admits: "Account::LedgerDirection"`).
    # Ruby checks BOTH doors (`admission.rb`'s own `check_admitted`/
    # `check_patterns`, called from `Value.build`, and `admit_declared_set`,
    # called from `coerce_declared_arguments`) — this file is the shared
    # half both `types.rb` (the value-object door) and `commands.rb` (the
    # command/entity-command-argument door) call into.

    # The scalar `admitted_scalar`/`check_patterns` actually operate on —
    # bare already if the attribute's own declared type IS the scalar
    # (`String`), or the sole field of a single-field value object (the
    # "one-field holder" `admission.rb`'s own comment names). `nil` for
    # anything else (a multi-field VO, a closed-set VO with more than one
    # discriminant) — not a shape either door can unwrap either.

    # set may be declared anywhere in the same chapter, not just the
    # current aggregate. `aggregates_by_name` is `domain_generator.rb`'s
    # own full-IR lookup (already built for `reference_checks`). `nil` —
    # not generated, not refused at runtime like Ruby's own
    # `undeclared_set` — when the target can't be resolved to an actual
    # closed-set value object at codegen time: there is no repository to
    # check against here, only a compile-time member table, so an
    # unresolvable target is the same "can't honestly generate this" shape
    # as every other skip in this generator.
