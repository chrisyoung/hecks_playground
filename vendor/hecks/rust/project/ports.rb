    # a list attribute carrying `admits:`/`pattern:` (the exact same
    # per-element gap `constraint_list_problems` already names for

    # object no OTHER attribute anywhere in this aggregate already forced
    # into existence — no real operation in this corpus does that; flagged

    # ── ONE emitter per port operation — the args struct plus a pure
    # dispatch function with no repo, no Hydrate, no mutation record: an
    # operation neither hydrates nor saves an aggregate instance
    # (`PortOperationInterpreter#call`'s own shorter `DISPATCH_ORDER`,
    # ported the same way `emit_entity_command` ports `EntityInterpreter
    # #call`'s). `registry.rb`'s own `emit_reference_check` runs BEFORE
    # this function is even called (the same "needs `store`, only exists
    # at the router level" reason a command's own reference checks do,
    # `reactions.rb`'s header) — by the time control reaches here, the
    # referenced aggregate is already known to exist, so this only builds
    # the event(s) the operation's own `emits` names, addressed by the
    # SAME identity attribute Ruby's `PortOperationInterpreter#emit`
    # reads (`ctx.args[identity_attribute.name]`). The payload this
    # function's own events carry is a placeholder (`Json::Null`) —
    # `registry.rb`'s generated call site wraps the return with the SAME
    # `stamp_payload(events, &payload)` a command's own dispatch call
    # already does, which REPLACES it with the router's real, raw
    # `args_json` — so this function never needs to build a correct
    # payload itself, only correct `name`/`aggregate`/`id`.
