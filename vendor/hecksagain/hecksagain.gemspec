    hecksagain reads a .bluebook file — a business domain's aggregates,
    value objects, commands, and invariants — and boots it directly.
    Nothing is scripted: no handler body, no class you write, no schema
    you migrate. Not published to rubygems.org; installed as a git or
    path dependency by projects that build on it, the way this
    gemspec exists to let Bundler do.

  # UNLIKE Postgres/Sqlite (ADAPTERS, reached only if a domain's
  # .hecksagon wires one — declaring them here would force a database
  # client library on every project that never touches either), prism
  # is a genuinely unconditional dependency: adapters/driven/prism.rb's
  # own `require "prism"` runs the moment `require "hecksagain"` does,
  # not lazily. Real, not merely tidy — Ruby 3.3+ bundles prism as a
  # default gem so this went unnoticed everywhere prism was already
  # present for free; Ruby 3.2 (AWS Lambda's own managed runtime, among
  # others) does not, and `require "hecksagain"` failed outright there
  # with prism undeclared (caught live building for Lambda).
