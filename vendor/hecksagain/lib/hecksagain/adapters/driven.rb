# `SequentialIdentity` — the deterministic identity_generation test
# double — is NOT required here on purpose. It lives at
# spec/fixtures/sequential_identity.{adapter,rb}, loaded explicitly by
# whichever spec wants it: this file's `require_relative` list is what
# `Folder#load_library`'s `.adapter` glob backs, and `.adapter` DSL
# declarations register into every registry any real `Hecks.boot` ever
# builds. Two adapters answering `identity_generation` unconditionally
# would make the port permanently ambiguous — `Ports::IdentityGeneration
# .adapter` refuses to choose between more than one — for every
# consumer, forever, not just specs that want the deterministic one.
