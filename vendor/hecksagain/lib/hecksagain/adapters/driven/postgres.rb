    # The first enforcement-grade persistence adapter — and the only one
    # that declares the LINEAGE capability: it may act on shape drift
    # (translate, fork, merge) where every other adapter can only refuse
    # toward it.
    #
    # Storage model (see postgres/lineage.rb for the DDL):
    # - One journal per DOMAIN, list-partitioned by era, one ordinal
    #   sequence spanning partitions. Appends go there; nothing updates
    #   or deletes a journal row (immutability by privilege — UPDATE and
    #   DELETE revoked; a deployment's app role connects as a non-owner).
    # - Per aggregate, the HEAD is derived: era 1 reads a plain view
    #   (latest save per id); later eras read a view overlaying the
    #   materialized, translated ancestor tail with live current-era
    #   rows. `project` is therefore a no-op — old entries are never
    #   rewritten, and the head is never a table anything writes.
    # - State is ONE jsonb column. jsonb normalizes key order (and drops
    #   duplicate keys), so anything comparing stored state — the corpus
    #   history gate above all — must compare CANONICALIZED state, never
    #   raw bytes; `bin/canonicalise` deep-sorts keys, which is exactly
    #   why the gate survives this normalization.
    # - Query pushdown is the shared SqlQueryBuilder: every declared
    #   operator compiles fully into SQL, or the query refuses loudly.
