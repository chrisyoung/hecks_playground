          # correct position for both rules in one pass. Chaining the
          # original edges in mint order reproduces the true execution
          # exactly and needs no such reasoning.
          # ONLY THE LATEST ANCESTOR ENTRY PER ID IS OBSERVABLE. The head,
          # the tail-merge, and the audit all reduce by

          #
          # The algebra it rests on, both halves load-bearing:
          #
          #   1. THE CUTS DO NOT MOVE. ancestor_tail_sql cuts ancestor k at
          #      W(k+1) — the watermark recorded when era k+1 was minted.
          #      Those are the SAME literals in the era N-1 build and the
          #      era N build, so era N-1's matview already carries exactly
          #      the cut era N needs for eras 1..N-2. Only era N-1's own
          #      rows are new, and they are cut at W(N). The watermark is
          #      still a literal baked into a definition; it is simply
          #      baked into the layer beneath. (This is why the tail-merge
          #      must pass full: — it moves every watermark at once.)
          #
          #   2. REDUCING IS ASSOCIATIVE. reduce(A ∪ B) == reduce(reduce(A) ∪ B),
          #      because the survivor is max-ordinal-per-id either way. So
          #      reducing per layer is the same answer as reducing the
          #      whole tail once.
          #
          # And every row on both sides of the union is already in era
          # N-1's shape — the matview because it was chained through edge
          # N-2, era N-1's own rows because that is the shape they were
          # written under — so the final edge applies uniformly, with no
          # per-era CASE. That equality is asserted, not argued: the spec
