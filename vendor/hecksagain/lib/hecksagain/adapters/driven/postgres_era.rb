    # The enforcement-grade persistence adapter — and the only one that
    # declares the LINEAGE capability: it may act on shape drift
    # (translate, fork, merge) where every other adapter can only refuse
    # toward it. Sibling to the plain `Postgres` adapter (postgres.rb),
    # which is the same database with none of this machinery — pick
    # PostgresEra only once a domain actually needs to survive a shape
    # change live. See docs/postgres-era-adapter-split-plan.md for why
    # the two are split and what each one carries.
    #
    # Storage model (see postgres_era/lineage.rb for the DDL):
    # - One journal per DOMAIN, list-partitioned by era, one ordinal
    #   sequence spanning partitions. Appends go there; nothing updates
    #   or deletes a journal row (immutability by privilege — UPDATE and
    #   DELETE revoked; a deployment's app role connects as a non-owner).
    # - Per aggregate, the HEAD is derived: era 1 reads a plain view
    #   (latest save per id); later eras read a view overlaying the
    #   materialized, translated ancestor tail with live current-era
    #   rows. `project` is therefore a no-op — old entries are never
    #   rewritten, and the head is never a table anything writes.
    # - State is ONE jsonb column. jsonb normalizes key order (and drops
    #   duplicate keys), so anything comparing stored state — the corpus
    #   history gate above all — must compare CANONICALIZED state, never
    #   raw bytes; `bin/canonicalise` deep-sorts keys, which is exactly
    #   why the gate survives this normalization.
    # - Query pushdown is the shared SqlQueryBuilder: every declared
    #   operator compiles fully into SQL, or the query refuses loudly.

      # `head_view`, which is already the fully-reduced current state —
      # but for a domain that has minted a second era, that reduction
      # itself is the expensive part, and no index on the jsonb path
      # changes that (see field_cache.rb's own header for the SQL-
      # semantics reason why). When every `where` clause this query
      # declares either targets a cached field or is eligible to (an
      # ordinary comparator, not a null-vs-value special case — see
      # `cache_eligible?`), skip the reduction: look candidate ids up in
      # the cache table(s) first (cheap, indexed, no reduction involved),
      # then read ONLY those ids' current state from `head_view` — safe
      # THROUGH the reduction because `id` is its own partition key. Any
      # clause that ISN'T cache-eligible (an uncached field, or a null
      # comparison) is simply re-checked against `head_view` in the
      # second phase, exactly as `super` would have checked it anyway —
      # this can only ever NARROW what phase two has to look at, never
      # change what a clause means.

      # FALLS BACK TO `super` WHENEVER NO CLAUSE CAN BE ACCELERATED — a
      # query with no `where` at all (order_by-only — no cache table
      # exists for these, see field_cache.rb), a query whose only clauses
      # target fields with no cache table, or a domain that has never
      # minted a second era at all (`@field_caches` is never empty just
      # because era 1 has no reduction to skip — the cache tables still
      # exist and still accelerate era 1 the same way, but the fallback
      # path is already just as cheap there since head_view IS the
