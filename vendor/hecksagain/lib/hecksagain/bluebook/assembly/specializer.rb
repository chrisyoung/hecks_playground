      # THE FIRST SPECIALIZER — a projection of `contracts.rb`'s `fields:` table,

      # `Plan` already reads `grammar_registry` to build the judge's walk ; this
      # reads the same chapter to build the OTHER table this arc's own header
      # names as duplication — "SPELLED AS THE IR SPELLS THEM," field for field,
      # for every category simple enough to say so.
      #
      # ONE CASE, PROVEN, NOT THE WHOLE TABLE. A field this can speak for is
      # scalar and not a reference — every other field (a list, a reference, a
      # fold like Lifecycle) is exactly what `contracts.rb`'s `reads:`/`derived:`
      # exist to say, and stays hand-written until a later projection learns to
      # derive readers and folds too. Restricting the claim to what can be
      # PROVEN CORRECT — checked in spec/specializer_spec.rb against two
      # independent categories — is the same discipline `derived:` itself
      # enforces : a claim needs a kind, and this one's kind is "plain, checked."

        # `position` IS THE FIRST FOLD THIS RUNS INTO, and it is a universal
        # one : every category declares `attribute :position, Position` — for
        # the JUDGE's own walk, `order_by :position` on its `DeclaredIn` ask —
        # but no `IR::*` constructor takes it as an argument. `contracts.rb`
        # already says so, in the language every other derived field speaks :
        # `derived: { position: :walk }`. The language says a category HAS a
        # position ; it does not say a category's OWN constructor is handed
        # one, and that second fact is exactly what `fields:` needs to answer.
        # So this is not silently special-cased — it is the one fold named
        # here because it is the one fold that is not a lucky accident of
        # Policy or Handler, but a fact true of every category this arc will
        # ever reach.
