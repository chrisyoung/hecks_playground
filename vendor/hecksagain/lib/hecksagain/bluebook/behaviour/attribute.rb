        # Required is the default and by far the common case — a command takes
        # the arguments it declares, and all of them — so the EXCEPTION is what
        # gets marked. Marking the other way would annotate almost every
        # attribute in the corpus to say nothing.
        #
        # Only a COMMAND enforces this. An aggregate's own attributes are filled
        # by the commands that set them, and a value object's by its
        # constructor ; neither is a payload anyone hands in.
