    # THE CHAPTER, and no longer the namespace it lives in.
    #
    # `Hecksagain::Bluebook` was briefly a CLASS, because dropping the
    # old `IR::` segment would otherwise have produced
    # `Bluebook::Bluebook` — a class shadowing its own enclosing module.
    # Naming the construct what the code already called it everywhere
    # (a chapter; this file was already chapter.rb) removes the clash
    # at the source, so the namespace goes back to being a module.
    #
    # Measured before changing: `Bluebook` was used AS a class in five
    # places and as a namespace in seventy-seven files.

      # THE SCHEMA'S OWN VERSION — not a domain's `version:` (Banking's
      # "v1", a business fact the AUTHOR chose), but the shape `to_h`
      # itself emits. A consumer reading exported IR with no Ruby DSL to
      # cross-check against (a build-time generator, a stored snapshot)
      # needs to know WHICH shape it's holding before it can safely
      # interpret any of the rest of it. Bump this when `to_h`'s own
      # shape changes in a way a consumer would need to know about —
      # not when a domain's own declarations change.
