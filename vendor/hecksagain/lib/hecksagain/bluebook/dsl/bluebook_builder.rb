        # A CHAPTER MAY BE DECLARED IN SEVERAL FILES, meant to merge into ONE
        # domain — `lib/hecksagain/language/bluebook/*.bluebook` all open
        # `Hecks.bluebook "Bluebook" do ... end`. Each `Hecks.bluebook` call used to
        # mint a fresh builder, so a second file with the same chapter name
        # silently replaced the first's aggregates instead of adding to them.
        #
        # The registry now holds the builder OPEN across calls : the first file
        # for a name creates it, every later file for the same name reuses the
        # same instance, so `@aggregates`/`@read_models` accumulate. `#build` is
        # safe to call once per file on the same builder — it constructs a fresh
        # `Bluebook` from whatever is currently held and re-`Namespace.install`s
        # over the previous one, so the LAST file's call leaves every aggregate
        # seen so far reachable, and each call's IR is a strict superset of the
        # one before. `Registry#add_bluebook` still simply stores by name — with
        # this in place, "last write wins" is the cumulative, correct write.

          # over a `ConstShim::ScopedConstant` (S0b, const_shim.rb's own comment),
          # and that is still the whole answer for a bare name: `Attribute` spells
          # it with `to_s`, so the `TypeName` wrapper this used to build existed
          # only long enough to be stringified. The concept still has a home — the
          # language declares `value_object "TypeName"` — it just needed no Ruby
          # class of its own. A Module rather than a Symbol is what also lets
          # `Account::Debit`/`admits: Account::LedgerDirection` answer their OWN
          # `::` — a plain Symbol cannot.
