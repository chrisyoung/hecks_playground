        # call one. An `asks` is dispatched like any other port operation, so
        # a `policy` can trigger it off an event, and it comes back as one of
        # the two events it named — which is what makes the outside world
        # something the model can reason about rather than a place exceptions

        # inbound fact into this domain's own event vocabulary — there is no
        # channel back to a caller beyond the events it emits. `verb` is the
        # opposite direction: the domain calling OUT to a swappable adapter
        # and getting a real value back (a checkout URL, a fetched document),
        # exactly what `Hecks.port "name" do verb "x" end` already builds —
        # this is that same `Port`, reached from the same `port` call
        # `operation` already lives under, so a project's own resource ports
        # read next to their binding instead of in a separate file. One port,
        # one shape or the other — never both.

        # SILENT MIS-RECORD for an effect-family one declared this way (the

        # :reply when unspecified, so every existing bare `verb "x"` caller
