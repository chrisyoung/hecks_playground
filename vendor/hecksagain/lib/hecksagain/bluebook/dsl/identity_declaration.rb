      # `identified_by` — SHARED by AggregateBuilder and EntityBuilder
      # only (S9, ADR 0025 — "EntityBuilder's duplicate identified_by and
      # resolve_pending_identity! go"): a piece's own identity cannot
      # spell differently from its aggregate's, and until this slice it
      # was hand-duplicated onto both rather than shared.
      #
      # A SEPARATE MODULE from AttributeCollector on purpose — every
      # `attribute()`-taking builder (Command, Query, PortOperation,
      # ValueObject, ...) `include`s that one too, and none of THEM
      # declares an identity of its own ; folding `identified_by` in
      # there made it answer for six builders that never earned the
      # word (`syntax_conformance_spec.rb` catches exactly this — a
      # builder answering a method the grammar never grants it).
      #
      # Requires its includer to ALSO `include AttributeCollector`
      # (for `attributes`/`resolve_identity_field!`/`resolve_identity_
      # type!`, still declared there since every includer of THAT
      # module needs them) and to supply `identity_pool` (private) —
      # the value-object list a bare field's own type resolves
      # against: AggregateBuilder's own `@value_objects + closed_sets`,
      # or EntityBuilder's OWNER's, since a piece mints none of its own.
      module IdentityDeclaration
        # WHICH UNCHANGING FACTS SAY WHICH ONE THIS IS — a declared field,
        # never a minted one (ADR 0025, "Identity"). `identified_by :number`
        # points at an attribute already declared on its own line — the
        # type used to be spelled here too ONLY because that was the one
        # place minting it, and minting is gone.
        #
        # SEVERAL FIELDS, and the identity is their JOIN, in declaration
        # order — composite identity is `identified_by :branch_code,
        # :box_number`, not a block. A single-field value object auto-
        # unwraps to its own member (see `resolve_identity_field!`,
        # AttributeCollector's own); a bare scalar or a reference resolves
        # to its own name unchanged.
