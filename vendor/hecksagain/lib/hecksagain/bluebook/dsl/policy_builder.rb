        # Same `key => value` shape a saga's own `dispatch ..., with:`
        # takes, and read the same way at runtime: a Symbol names a field
        # on the triggering event, anything else is a literal the policy
        # supplies itself. The reason it exists is the reason a saga's
        # does — a reaction crosses an aggregate boundary, and the event
        # on one side is under no obligation to be shaped like the
        # command on the other. Without it the target has to DECLARE
        # every field the event happens to carry, whether it reads them
        # or not.

        # way `reference_to Account` always has, not a quoted verb string.

        # saga's own `dispatch` used to disagree about — see
        # `Naming.command_ref`'s own header for how the `::`/`.` rewrite
        # works, and `SagaInterpreter#qualified` for why an unqualified
        # form has always been enough (same-domain is the fallback, so

        # thing here).
