        # A Reference is kept AS ITSELF. Every other type is still a name, and
        # crosses over as its construct does.
        #
        # `admits` names an ALREADY-DECLARED closed set the value must belong
        # to — `Vocabulary::QueryComparator` — spelled aggregate-qualified
        # because the set is a value object INSIDE an aggregate, and the
        # aggregate is the only thing `reference_to` can reach.
        #
        # ON THE WIRE, because it is a RULE and not only a typing hint.
        #
        # It began as neither. The link existed so a generator could type
        # `WhereClause.op` as `WhereOp` — a typing convenience, not worth
        # moving 710 attribute records across eight goldens for. Then `admits`
        # grew teeth (coercion refuses a non-member) and the argument
        # inverted: a rule the wire does not carry is one a reader of the IR
        # cannot enforce, and a bluebook whose meaning depends on the reader
        # means two things. Proved rather than assumed — the same domain
        # refused "burnt" through one reading and emitted the event through
        # another.
        #
        # The wire carries the NAME, not the members. A reader resolves it
        # against the IR it holds, so the members are declared once and
        # copied nowhere — which is the same reason `admits` exists at all.
        # `logged:`, vendored addition not (yet) upstream hecksagain
        # (migration plan task 4): `attribute :old_string, OldString,
        # logged: false` (framework/tools/bluebook/tools.bluebook) --
        # marks a field as excluded from the audit-log record (a large or
        # sensitive payload -- a diff's old_string/new_string, file
        # content -- that shouldn't ride the event-log trail whole).
        # Defaults true (logged unless told otherwise). Captured
        # structurally so the corpus boots ; NOT yet consulted by
        # whatever writes the audit log -- a documented gap, matching
        # this session's other structural-only additions. TODO upstream
        # via bin/evolve (migration plan task 7).
