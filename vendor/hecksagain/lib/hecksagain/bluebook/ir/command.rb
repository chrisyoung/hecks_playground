      # A command, as a RUBY CLASS.
      #
      # NOT nested as a constant, and that is a finding rather than a shortcut. A
      # command and a value object may legitimately share a name inside one
      # aggregate — the language does it six times, and means it: the command
      # `Argument` is the verb that appends to the `arguments` list whose element
      # type is the value object `Argument`, and `Plan` reads exactly that pairing.
      # So `Bluebook::Command::Argument` cannot be both, and a single constant
      # namespace cannot index a kind-ambiguous name. The same follows for
      # `hecks_fqn` : `Bluebook::Command.Argument` names both, which is why the judge's
      # ids only work per-category, each in its own repository. IDENTITY IS
      # (KIND, FQN), not fqn.
      #
      # It is a declaration holder anyway, because that is where the EDGES live.
      # `acts_on` answers with the owning construct itself — the IR::Aggregate,
      # or the entity holder for a piece's verb — rather than the name of one.
      # The invocation door (`pizza.add_topping`) is the facade's business, a
      # per-boot projection ; no verb method is defined here.
