      # An entity, as a RUBY CLASS — a piece of an aggregate that has an identity
      # of its own.
      #
      # Crossing over closes the OWNER CHAIN. An entity declares commands, and
      # until now those commands had no owner that could state an identity: an
      # entity was an IR object, not a construct, so `Construct#hecks_fqn` refused
      # rather than answering "Deposit" and looking right. Four of banking's
      # commands were in that state. They can say what they are now —
      # `Banking::Account.Ledger.Deposit` — which is the id the judge already mints
      # for them.
      #
      # NOT const_set, for the same reason a command is not: a name inside one
      # aggregate can denote more than one kind of thing, so the constant tree
      # cannot index it.
      #
      # It must stay STRUCTURALLY INTERCHANGEABLE with an aggregate — the runtime
      # builds `Instance.new(aggregate: entity)` and `CommandRules` takes either as
      # `declaring` — so it answers `hecks_name`, `attributes`, `attribute`,
      # `identified_by` and `lifecycle` exactly as an aggregate does. And it must
      # keep NOT answering `value_object`: `Value.for_attribute` sniffs for that
      # method to tell a piece from a head.
