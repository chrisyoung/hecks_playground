      # A value object — a DECLARATION HOLDER, never instantiated.

      # `ValueObjectBuilder` returns an anonymous subclass whose singleton
      # carries the declaration : attributes, invariants, members. Nothing ever
      # calls `.new` on one — coercion builds `Runtime::Value` wrappers, and
      # invariants run as canonical text through the Evaluator. The runtime
      # reaches a shape through `aggregate.value_object(name)`, the IR's own
      # finder ; there is no constant nesting and no second index.
      #
      # `to_h` does not move. It is a byte-for-byte contract pinned by the
      # golden fixtures, so it keeps spelling the short declared name, which
      # is what `hecks_name` carries. DECLARATIONS IN THE GRAPH, STRINGS IN THE
      # EXPORT.
