    # Judges a bluebook by DISPATCHING it into the language declared in itself.
    #
    # `lib/hecksagain/language/bluebook/` declares what a bluebook IS —
    # Chapter, Root, Verb, Shape, Ask, Piece, and the rest, split across nine
    # files by function and merged into one chapter at load time (see
    # GRAMMAR_FILES below) — and carries the language's rules as `given` and
    # `invariant` rather than as `raise Malformed` scattered across seven
    # builder files. This replays a built IR into that domain and turns any
    # refusal into a Malformed, so the meta-domain is what actually judges
    # rather than a description sitting beside the code.
    #
    # Delete language/bluebook/ and validation stops. That is the whole
    # point : a self-description that only describes is indistinguishable from
    # enforcement, and the first version of this file was deleted for exactly
    # that reason.
    #
    # The meta-domain is loaded ONCE and its registry reused ; each bluebook is
    # judged in a fresh in-memory store so no domain can see another's records.
    module MetaValidator
      # THE CHAPTER, SPLIT BY FUNCTION, MERGED AT LOAD TIME. One 1973-line file
      # became nine, grouped by what each piece of the language IS (a root, what
      # it can do, what it is made of, what reacts to it, its closed vocabulary,
      # the read-back) rather than left as one undifferentiated block. Every file
      # opens the SAME `Hecks.bluebook "Bluebook" do ... end` ; `BluebookBuilder.build`
      # keeps one builder open per chapter name across calls (see its own comment),
      # so loading all nine in order accumulates one domain, not nine.
      #
      # ORDER IS AN EXPLICIT LIST, not a sorted glob. Declaration order is a fact
      # about the source — the golden IR fixture pins the exact sequence — and a
      # filename-alphabetical sort would not reproduce a deliberate, reviewed order
      # by accident. This is the array to edit when a file is added, removed, or
      # reordered.

      # and exactly why the language could only validate. It returns what the
      # meta-domain HOLDS instead, assembled into the graph the runtime runs. The
      # builder's own object graph now exists only to be dispatched; nothing keeps
      # it.

      # is the difference between a language that checks a domain and a language
      # that is the source of one.
      #
      # What is CACHED is the declarations, not the graph. A hash carries no Ruby
      # classes, so a second load of the same chapter re-assembles fresh ones —
      # which is the behaviour `Namespace.install` and `spec/construct_spec` both
      # expect. Caching the graph would hand two boots the same classes.
      # THE LANGUAGE IS THE SOURCE. This is the line that makes it one.

      # `Hecks.bluebook` registers whatever comes back from here, so returning the
      # assembled graph rather than the bluebook it was handed is the whole swap: the
      # runtime runs what the meta-domain HOLDS. The builder's own graph exists only
      # to be dispatched in ; nothing keeps it.
      #
      # It stayed unlanded for one wrong belief, worth naming because it looked so
      # much like a wall: that the language may only hold what `to_h` carries.

      # seemed impossible to read back —
      # and hoisted policies lost which head declared them for the same reason.
      # But `to_h` is a PROJECTION and the language is the
      # SOURCE. They must agree about everything to_h spells ; they need not be the
      # same size. Both are held now, as declarations the wire format never sees, and
      # the wire format did not move an inch.
