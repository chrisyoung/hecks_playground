      # This used to be one hand-written branch per category, and the cost of that
      # shape was fourteen verbs the language declared and the judge never offered
      # — among them `Command.Argument` and `ValueObject.Field`, so a command's own
      # arguments and a value object's own fields were NEVER judged. Every rule
      # hanging off them was decoration. Nothing went red, because a branch that
      # does not exist cannot fail.
      #
      # So there are no branches. The judge WALKS: it reads the plan the language
      # makes of itself (Plan), and for each node offers the creating command, then
      # each list through the command that appends to it, then each child. A verb
      # in the plan with no offer is now impossible — there is no branch left in
      # which to forget one, and spec/judge_coverage_spec holds it to that.
      #
      # What is NOT uniform lives in Readings, and only where the IR's SHAPE
      # differs from the language's. Naming differences do not appear at all: the
      # language spells its fields as the IR spells them.
      #
      # Only the DISPATCH half of the round trip lives here. Reconstruction is the
      # experiment's business ; judging does not need it.
