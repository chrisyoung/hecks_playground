      # What the language says about ITSELF, read back as something walkable.
      #
      # The judge used to carry one hand-written branch per category, and the
      # reason given for keeping it that way was that "which append command
      # belongs to which list is not derivable from a name". True — and beside
      # the point. It is derivable from the language's own IR, because every
      # append command DECLARES its target:
      #
      #     command "Argument" do
      #       reference_to Command
      #       then_set :arguments, append: { name: :name, type: :type, ... }
      #     end
      #
      # That one line says both things a walk needs: `Command.Argument` is the
      # appender for the `arguments` list, and the map binds each value-object
      # field to the command argument that fills it. Nothing is matched by name.
      #
      # The same reading recovers the containment tree. A command with NO
      # self-reference is the creating one, and the `*_id` argument it carries
      # names the parent — so Bluebook -> Aggregate -> Command / ValueObject /
      # Query / Entity, ValueObject -> Member, ProcessManager -> Handler ->
      # Dispatch all fall out of the declarations rather than being restated here.
      #
      # Usage:
      #
      #     plan = Plan.for(MetaValidator.grammar_registry)
      #     plan.category("Command").parent            # => "Aggregate"
      #     plan.category("Command").appends["rules"]  # => Append(verb: "Rule", map: {...})
      #     plan.verbs                                 # every Bluebook:: verb declared
