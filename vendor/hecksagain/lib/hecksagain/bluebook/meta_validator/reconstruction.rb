      # A bluebook rebuilt FROM the meta-domain, in the shape the builder produces.
      #
      # This is the second half of the claim at the top of bluebook.bluebook —
      # "loading a domain becomes dispatching commands into this meta-domain ; the
      # IR it stores must equal the IR the DSL builder produces". The judge is the
      # first half. This reads the records back and assembles `to_h`.
      #
      # It is the INVERSE OF THE WALK and shares its plan: the walk reads a node's
      # lists through the command that appends to each, and this reads them back out
      # of the rows those commands wrote. The retired `experiment/replay.rb` needed
      # 420 hand-written lines because the dispatch half was hand-written too; there
      # is nothing to hand-write when both directions are one table.
      #
      # This file is the TRAVERSAL. The hashes at its tips, and the encodings they
      # undo, are in Shapes.
      #
      # IT READS LEVEL BY LEVEL, THROUGH `DeclaredIn`, AND NOT THROUGH THE READ
      # MODEL — which is the difference between a reconstruction that can be the
      # SOURCE and one that can only be a check.
      #
      # `Meta.whole_bluebook` gathers a chapter in a single read, and it sorts:
      # `ReadModelInterpreter#matching` ends `.sort_by(&:id)` deliberately, because
      # a store's iteration order is an accident, and a read model returning store
      # order would let that accident leak into an answer.
      # Right for a read model, fatal here — the order a bluebook declares its
      # commands in is a FACT ABOUT THE SOURCE, and the IR is a contract field for
      # field and index for index ; the export carries that order verbatim.
      # `DeclaredIn` preserves it (spec/executes_spec says so), so this asks each
      # level for its own children rather than filtering one sorted gather.
      #
      # The parent key of every level is read from the language's own plan, the same
      # Plan the walk dispatches from — so the two directions really are one table,
      # which is what the header above has always claimed.
      #
      # WHAT IT CANNOT REBUILD matters as much as what it can, and
      # spec/round_trip_spec pins the difference as an exact set: a field the language
      # does not hold appears there as a named gap, and a field it stops holding
      # appears as a failure.
