      # S14, ADR 0026 — DISPATCHES THE LANGUAGE'S OWN GRAMMAR TABLE INTO
      # ITSELF, once, so `Keyword`/`Argument`'s own `status` genuinely IS a
      # lifecycle — checked at real dispatch time (the same admission/
      # coercion/lifecycle-guard door every other command goes through),
      # not merely declared and never exercised.
      #
      # THE SOURCE STAYS STATIC. `syntax.bluebook`'s own `KeywordSeed`/
      # `ArgumentSeed` (still ~106/~178 hand-written `member` rows —
      # nothing about them needed rewriting) are what gets WRITTEN ; this
      # is what turns them into what gets READ. `Judge`/`Reconstruction`
      # already draw exactly this line everywhere else in the meta-domain
      # (a chapter's own DECLARATIONS versus what gets DISPATCHED from
      # them) — this runs the same distinction one level further out, for
      # the language's own grammar table.
      #
      # A DEDICATED RUNTIME, not `MetaValidator.fresh_runtime`. That one
      # is reserved for `Judge`'s own bootstrap (dispatching a CHAPTER's
      # declarations INTO the meta-domain's grammar) — a different act
      # from this one (dispatching the meta-domain's OWN grammar table
      # data into a live "Bluebook" domain instance). Sharing the runtime
      # would let one boot's own repository state leak into the other's.
      #
      # Usage:
      #
      #   MetaValidator.syntax_table  # => { keywords: [...], arguments: [...] }
      #
      # each row a plain Hash, string values, `status` included — the
      # exact shape `ParserTable`/`syntax_conformance_spec` already read
      # off the OLD closed-set members, so neither consumer had to change
      # what it does with a row, only where the row comes from.
