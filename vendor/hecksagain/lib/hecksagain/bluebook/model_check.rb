    # every process manager a declared protocol, and BOTH are already
    # data, not code, so they can be MODEL-CHECKED rather than merely
    # executed. Static analysis only — no bluebook boots twice, no
    # runtime is touched — over what meta_validator/judge.rb and the
    # builders' own `validate!` methods leave uncovered (an undeclared
    # transition target, a dispatch to nowhere, a compensation nothing
    # can ever reach).
    #
    # THE RARE PROPERTY THIS RESTS ON: the model IS the implementation.
    # A checker over TLA+ verifies a SPEC a human keeps in sync with
    # code by hand ; this verifies the same IR the runtime dispatches
    # against, so there is no second copy to drift.
