    # Declared properties, checked over a REPLAYED history — the other
    # half of property-based testing the fuzzer was missing: it already
    # generates and (with bin/fuzz's shrinker) minimizes, but checked
    # nothing beyond "did the interpreter crash" and "did the replay
    # match the claim." A property here is a fact that should hold of
    # ANY history a valid domain produces, independent of which seed
    # produced it.
    #
    # Each property is `name => ->(history) { true/false, or a message
    # string naming what broke }` — a truthy return (including `true`)
    # is a pass; a String return is a failure, and the string IS the
    # finding. `history` is Replay's return shape.
    #
    # EVERY PROPERTY DECLARES THE LANGUAGE FEATURE IT COVERS, in
    # `FEATURE_COVERAGE` below — a "Construct#attribute" pair spelled
    # exactly as `Bluebook::MetaValidator.grammar_registry` names it,
    # the SAME meta-domain that judges every real bluebook (see that
    # module's own header: "the language IS the source"). That is the
    # link this file exists to make real: a construct the language
    # declares is a fact `spec/meta_domain_coverage_spec.rb` can
    # enumerate on its own, without anyone re-typing the list here —
    # so a new attribute added to `language/bluebook/*.bluebook` shows
    # up in that spec as UNCLAIMED the moment it lands, not whenever
    # someone remembers to go looking. Claiming a feature here is a
    # deliberate act (a real property, checked at least once failing
    # AND once passing — `spec/fuzzing/properties_spec.rb`'s own
    # discipline) or an explicit, reasoned exemption in that same
    # spec — never silence.

      # FEATURES A REPLAY PROPERTY COULD NEVER CATCH VIOLATED, because the

      # produce in the first place — not "untested," but unfalsifiable by
      # a history, the same class of guarantee this codebase already
      # states for identity ("NOTHING IS MINTED" — command_interpreter.rb's
      # own header) and now generalises. Each entry names the ONE place in
      # the runtime that makes it true, universally, for every domain and
      # every adapter — never per-domain logic a future domain could
      # accidentally route around.
      #
      # THE BLUEBOOK/HECKSAGON BOUNDARY IS WHY THIS WORKS: a bluebook
      # declares SHAPE (attribute types, patterns, closed sets, VO
      # invariants — see docs/decisions/0009), and shape is enforced by
      # ONE coercion door every domain's every attribute passes through
      # (`Runtime::Value.build`, via value/coercion.rb + value/admission.rb)
      # regardless of which hecksagon later binds the aggregate to Memory,
      # Postgres, or anything else. A value that violated its own declared
      # pattern, invariant, or closed set could never be COERCED, so it
      # could never be STORED, so it could never appear in a replay's own
      # `:instances` to be caught violating it. Checking for it after the
      # fact would be watching for something the construction path already
      # made impossible.
      #
      # NOT a place to hide a real gap — a feature belongs here only once
      # the SPECIFIC enforcing code path has been read and confirmed, the
      # same discipline `spec/fuzzing/meta_domain_coverage_spec.rb` demands
      # of `KNOWN_GAPS` in the other direction. `Entity#identified_by` was
      # checked FOR this category once before and found NOT to qualify —
      # `command_interpreter.rb`'s `AlreadyExists` refusal was given to
      # every CREATING AGGREGATE command uniformly, and MutationApplier
      # (command_interpreter/mutation_applier.rb) had no matching check on
      # an entity's own append. It does now: #check_entity_collision runs
      # unconditionally on both branches an entity identity can arrive by
      # (caller-supplied, or composite — the two the auto-mint branch
      # doesn't cover), the same way command_interpreter#hydrate's own
      # check is unconditional for every creating aggregate command. Real,
