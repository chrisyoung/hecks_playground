    # A step list, replayed IN-PROCESS against a fresh boot — the same
    # copy-to-tmp-and-reset preamble SequenceGenerator#call uses, and the
    # same observable surface bin/run prints (instances, events,
    # refusals, reactions, sagas, queries), but returned as data rather
    # than JSON on stdout.
    #
    # NOT what SequenceGenerator itself dispatches through while
    # generating — that inline execution feeds the picker's own
    # known_ids tracking and stays exactly as it is. This exists for
    # everything ELSE that needs "given a step list, boot fresh and tell
    # me what happened": bin/fuzz recomputing a shrink candidate's TRUE
    # event count (removing a step changes what the sequence actually
    # produces, so a shrunk candidate cannot reuse the original claim),
    # and the declared-property checks in properties.rb. Both want it
    # in-process — a property or a shrink-candidate check is a question
    # this boot can answer itself, and paying for a subprocess and a
    # second boot to ask it would be ~100x the cost for nothing.
    #
    # Refuses the same way SequenceGenerator's own safe_call does: a
    # DOMAIN_REFUSAL or an EvaluationError is the domain declining a
    # step, recorded and not fatal to the replay. Anything else
    # propagates — a step that breaks the interpreter is a defect, not
    # an observation to fold quietly into the history.
