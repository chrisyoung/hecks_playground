    # WHAT SEPARATES THE PARTS OF A DERIVED IDENTITY.
    #
    # An identity of several parts is their JOIN, and the join has to be spelled the
    # same everywhere or two readers name two different records off one declaration.
    # It was spelled three ways at once here — "::" for an aggregate under a
    # chapter, "." for everything under an aggregate, "#" for the three that keyed
    # off position — and each was written where it happened to be needed. Once the
    # runtime derived the same identity, the runtime made a FOURTH, and a reference
    # that resolved by string comparison found nothing.

    # first-class). Ruby's `::` joins EVERY segment the same way a

    # its aggregate with `.` (`Construct#hecks_separator`'s default,

    # and re-splitting that by content rather than by TYPE would corrupt
    # it (its own last `::` sits between the domain and the aggregate,
    # not the aggregate and the command). Only an actual constant object
