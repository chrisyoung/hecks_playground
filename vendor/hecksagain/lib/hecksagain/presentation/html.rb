    # Hand-rolled, on purpose — the repo has no ERB anywhere and no template
    # engine dependency (see docs/presentation-bluebook.md's survey). Every
    # other generator in this codebase (bin/reference's markdown, the IR's own
    # `to_h`) builds output as plain Ruby strings; this does the same for HTML,
    # with exactly one job: nothing that reaches `Escape.html` ever becomes a
    # tag. A feature developer's own domain data — a customer's name, an
    # account number a support rep typed into a form and got wrong — flows
    # through here on every render, so escaping is not optional decoration.
    module Escape
      # Order matters — `&` first, or every escape this method itself just
      # wrote (`&amp;`, `&lt;`, ...) gets re-escaped a second time.
      def self.html(value)
        value.to_s
             .gsub("&", "&amp;")
             .gsub("<", "&lt;")
             .gsub(">", "&gt;")
             .gsub('"', "&quot;")
             .gsub("'", "&#39;")

      # Safe inside a double-quoted HTML attribute specifically — `html`
      # already covers this (it escapes `"`), kept as a named alias so a
      # call site reads "this value fills an attribute" rather than repeating
      # the same escaping and leaving the reader to check they match.
      def self.attr(value) = html(value)
    end

    # A tiny attribute-hash -> string helper, shared by every renderer in
    # this directory so `<input ...>` doesn't get hand-assembled five
    # different ways with five different escaping bugs waiting in each.
    # `true` renders as a bare boolean attribute (`required`, not
    # `required="true"`); `nil`/`false` are dropped entirely.
