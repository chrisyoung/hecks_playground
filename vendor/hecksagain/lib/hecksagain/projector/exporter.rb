      # A BINDING fact, deliberately NOT folded into `call`/`bluebook.to_h`
      # above — the canonical IR is runtime-independent by design (ADR
      # 0001: it describes what a bluebook DECLARES, never which adapter
      # a deployment happens to bind it to), and "is this aggregate bound
      # to a lineage-capable adapter" is exactly the kind of fact that
      # answer can change per-deployment without the bluebook's own shape
      # changing at all. Consumers that need it (bin/project_rust's own
      # `ir.json` sidecar, rust/host's runtime era-aware seed overlay —
      # dispatch.rs) merge this in as a SEPARATE top-level key, the same
      # way `translations` already sits beside `call`'s output rather than
      # inside it.
      #
      # Reuses `Runtime::EraCheck`'s own capability predicates rather than
      # re-deriving them — the boot-time gate and this export must never
      # answer differently for the same aggregate.
