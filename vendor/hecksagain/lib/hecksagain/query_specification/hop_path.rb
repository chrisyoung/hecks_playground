    # ONE reading of a dotted query-field path that hops THROUGH a
    # reference into another aggregate's own shape — FieldPath's
    # sibling, not its member. FieldPath walks a SHAPE, which cannot
    # loop, and answers nil, never raising, because there is nothing
    # left to say beyond "not found." HopPath walks the REFERENCE
    # GRAPH instead, which the language does not guarantee acyclic —
    # aggregates only refuse a DIRECT bidirectional pair
    # (BluebookBuilder#validate_no_bidirectional_references! explicitly
    # declines to take a position on a longer ring) — so a walk here
    # needs to say WHY it stopped, not just that it did.
    #
    # Every method below takes an ATTRIBUTE ARRAY, never a "shape"
    # object — deliberately, because the two real callers hold their
    # attributes differently. `AggregateBuilder` (tier-1 seal, mid-
    # build) exposes `attributes` as a plain reader, but its own
    # `attribute(name, type = String, ...)` is the DSL's attribute-
    # DECLARING method — calling it as a finder would silently mint a
    # new String attribute instead of looking one up. A sealed
    # `IR::Aggregate` (tier-2 seal, and every runtime target) has a
    # real `attribute(name)` finder, but taking the array either way
    # sidesteps the mismatch instead of asking every caller to know
    # which kind of object it holds.

      # at declaration time, and every step consumes exactly one of
      # its own segments — the walk is bounded by what was TYPED, not
      # by the graph. A self-referential aggregate hopping through
      # itself more than once (`"parent.parent.name"`, a grandparent
      # query) is real, common, and perfectly safe; this exists only
      # to refuse a chain nobody meant to write this long.

      # name, so `client_id` (the raw attribute) is never read as a
      # hop even though `client` (its accessor) is. Answerable from
      # `attributes` alone — a Reference knows its own `target_name`
