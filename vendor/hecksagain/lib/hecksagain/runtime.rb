# Hecksagain::Runtime
#
# The runtime layer's face. `lib/hecksagain/runtime/` held thirteen files and
# no parent, so the layer had no surface of its own : `lib/hecksagain.rb`
# required each file by hand, and the runtime's own state — the registry a
# declaration is being collected into — sat on the top-level Hecksagain module
# beside the DSL words.
#
# What lives here is what RUNS a domain :
#
#   Runtime.boot(path)          load a directory and return its Dispatcher
#   Runtime.with_registry(r)    bind the ambient registry for the duration of a load
#   Runtime.current_registry    the registry a declaration is landing in, or nil
#
# What does NOT live here is what DECLARES one — `Hecks.bluebook`,
# `.hecksagon`, `.port`, `.adapter`, `.world` are loading words and stay on the
# top-level module, which now reads as a facade over this.
#
#   runtime = Hecksagain::Runtime.boot("examples/pizzas/bluebook")
#   runtime.dispatch("Pizzas::Pizza.CreatePizza", name: "Margherita")
#
# NOTE, and it is the reason this file exists : `current_registry` is still
# process-global. Each boot builds a fresh Registry, and `Loader.bind_runtime`
# installs a fresh facade door whose modules close over THAT boot's dispatcher
# — no class-level runtime binding remains, so two boots in one process no
# longer share dispatch state, only the top-level NAME (the last-bound door
# wins the constant, which is what per-boot install means). Owning the state
# here was the first move ; the dispatcher reachable per-runtime rather than
# through a constant was the second, and it is done — the door is the only
# constant left, and it is a projection, not the runtime.
