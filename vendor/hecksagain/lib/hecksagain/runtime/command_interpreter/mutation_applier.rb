        # a prior save) keeps going through

        # "already-Value-wrapped field still mutates correctly" case
        # this fix must not regress), while a phantom field's raw
        # `current` and raw `amount` both take the plain-Numeric path
        # together. This method closes the other half: the plain-Numeric
        # path returns a bare Ruby number, and if the attribute is
        # itself VO-typed (the norm), that raw result needs the SAME
        # wrap `:set` already gives its own resolved value (`Value.for`)

        # on which dispatch happened to mutate it first. A no-op
