        # Integer `0` -- so `current.is_a?(Value) && amount.is_a?(Value)`

        # unconditional line) genuinely held a valid, correctly-typed
        # number, and the primitive path's `unless amount.is_a?(Numeric)`
        # guard refused it as a TYPE MISMATCH the caller never made --
        # an artifact of this method's own asymmetric wrapping, not bad
        # input. Confirmed live via CircuitBreaker::Breaker.RecordFailure
        # and MindStream::MindStream.Think, both on a freshly-created
        # record's first-ever mutation of the field (real-dispatch smoke
        # sweep across miette).
        #
        # Fixed at the call site (above) by wrapping `amount` ONLY when
        # `current` is ALREADY a `Value` -- so an established VO-typed
        # field (a multi-field Money balance, say, already hydrated from
        # a prior save) keeps going through
        # `Arithmetic#arithmetic_value_object` exactly as before (the
        # "already-Value-wrapped field still mutates correctly" case
        # this fix must not regress), while a phantom field's raw
        # `current` and raw `amount` both take the plain-Numeric path
        # together. This method closes the other half: the plain-Numeric
        # path returns a bare Ruby number, and if the attribute is
        # itself VO-typed (the norm, per Part 3a's bare-primitive
        # auto-synthesis), that raw result needs the SAME wrap `:set`
        # already gives its own resolved value (`Value.for`) before it's
        # stored, so a field's stored shape doesn't depend on which
        # dispatch happened to mutate it first. A no-op whenever
