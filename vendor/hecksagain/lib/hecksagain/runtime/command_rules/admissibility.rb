        # optional attribute as nil, not "cannot resolve." `Instance
        # #hydrate_with_defaults` deliberately leaves one absent rather
        # than nil-filled — "an attribute with no default stays absent,
        # exactly as stored," that file's own comment — which is right
        # for storage fidelity but wrong for a `given`/`ensures` reading
        # an optional field a record predates (measured, not assumed: a
        # real Item.Promote crashed on `!promoted` against a record from
        # before `promoted` existed). Defensive on purpose — a `subject`
        # with no `.aggregate` (an entity's own view/settled wrapper,
        # entity_interpreter.rb's own callers) just degrades to today's
        # exact behavior, zero risk to a path this bug was never measured

        # NIL IS NOT THE ONLY OUTCOME, though. The Item.Promote fix above

        # NON-optional field predating a record read nil the same way,
        # which is the `ne:`/array-`in:` bug class applied to rule
        # evaluation: a predicate silently answers against a value nobody
        # ever wrote (ADR 0025, "Added attributes and absence"). `[]`
        # below narrows the nil-read back to what it was built for —
        # optional stays nil, non-optional raises a named refusal
