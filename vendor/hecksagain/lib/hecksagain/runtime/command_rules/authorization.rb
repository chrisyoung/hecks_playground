      # the one check that runs before any domain-state work, alongside the

      #
      # TWO CHECKS, NOT A REPLACEMENT — ADR 0025 §9's own caution against
      # "silently downgrading `role` to documentation" cuts both ways: a
      # caller who never named WHO they are (every caller before this) is
      # checked exactly the way it always has been, string equality
      # against the command's own `role`. Only a caller that ALSO binds an
      # `actor_id` (`Hecksagain.as_caller(role:, actor_id:)`) reaches the
      # real check — a live Governance::RoleAssignment lookup through
      # `Ports::Authorization`, once the command's domain declares
      # `uses_framework "Governance"` (`HecksagonBuilder` refuses any
      # domain that declares a `role` and does not, at build time — see
      # its own `refuse_ungoverned_roles!`). An identified caller is never
      # let back through the string fallback: a real identity that holds
      # no matching grant is refused, not waved through because it also
      # happens to type the right word.

        # today. No role declared: unchecked too — `role` is genuinely
        # optional in this language (roughly a third of banking's own
        # commands declare none), so a command that never named a role has
        # nothing to check a caller against.
