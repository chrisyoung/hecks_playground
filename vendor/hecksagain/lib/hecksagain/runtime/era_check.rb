    # The boot-time era gate, run for the adapters that HAVE eras — the
    # lineage-capable ones. An era is a fact about stored data that some
    # adapter can carry across a shape change; an adapter that cannot
    # translate has no era to hold, and holding one for it would record
    # history about data nothing can act on.
    #
    # The whole domain is handed to the capable adapter's own era check
    # (Postgres: hold, recognize, mint, or refuse toward the scaffold),
    # which keeps its era facts as rows BESIDE its data. That
    # co-location is load-bearing — a watermark only means something
    # against the journal it was cut from, and an approval recorded
    # anywhere but the reviewed database binds to nothing.
    #
    # The capability is asked of the adapter, never of its name: a
    # second adapter that grows an era story declares lineage_capable?
    # and era_check! and needs no change here.
    #
    # Detection and identity are separate jobs: this check never hashes
    # anything — era names come from the store, already minted (by the
    # scaffold) or absent. Refusal wordings are contract, pinned by the
    # corpus.

        # task 8, embryonautfoundersapp finding): content match FIRST, not
        # basename match -- `stage_flat_corpus` flattens a whole project
        # into ONE numeric-prefixed directory (`042_foo.bluebook`), so
        # `File.basename(path, ".bluebook") == bluebook.name` (pascal-
        # cased) can never hit -- the prefix always sits in front of it.
        # Stripping the prefix wouldn't have been enough either: a real
        # corpus file is free to be named in a way that doesn't
        # round-trip through `Naming.pascal` at all (found live:
        # `embryonautfoundersapp.bluebook`, an all-lowercase, no-
        # separator filename, pascal-cases to "Embryonautfoundersapp",
        # never "EmbryonautFoundersApp" -- the declared domain name's own
        # internal capitalization is lost the moment the filename has no
        # word boundaries to carry it). The flatten also copies a
        # domain's `translations/*.bluebook` era-history siblings
        # (`Hecks.data_translation ...`, a different top-level construct
        # entirely) into the SAME directory as the real bluebook, which
        # used to be invisible to this glob (non-recursive, and
        # `translations/` sits one level down) before staging made it
        # recursive-by-copy -- inflating `domain_files.size` past 1 and
        # silently defeating the single-file fallback below, which is
        # what actually broke this case (the ORIGINAL, un-staged
        # directory has exactly one top-level `.bluebook` file, so the
        # fallback already covered it fine).
        # The fix: read each candidate file's OWN `Hecks.bluebook "Name"`
        # declaration line and match it directly against bluebook.name --
        # the exact fact this function is trying to establish, rather
        # than inferring it from a filename convention. Same regex
        # `hecksagain_runtime.rb`'s `domain_name_of` already uses for
        # topo-sort ordering, so this is a second, independent consumer
        # of an already-proven-reliable signal, not a new heuristic.
        # Immune to numeric prefixing, disambiguation-prefixing, and
        # non-word-boundary filenames alike, since it never reads the
        # filename at all. Falls through to the old basename heuristic
        # and single-file fallback unchanged, so nothing that used to
