    # Detects when a bluebook's storage shape has drifted from what its data

    # something that only makes sense once you already suspect a rename.

    # The held source is a snapshot of the bluebook text as it stood the
    # last time its shape was accepted. It updates only when a drift is
    # seen AND covered by a translation — never on every boot, and never
    # silently when a rename has nothing to explain it.
