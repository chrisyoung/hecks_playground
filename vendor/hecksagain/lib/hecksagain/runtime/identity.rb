    # THE SCALAR AN IDENTITY PATH NAMES.
    #
    # An identity is DECLARED as a path — `identified_by :number` — and
    # this is the one place that reads one. It follows the path and nothing else.
    #
    # What it replaced was `Value.identifier`, which opened a one-field value
    # object and took whatever was inside : that let `identified_by :number` pass
    # for an identity, with the runtime guessing which field had been meant. The
    # guess is gone. A declaration that names no field is now refused when the
    # bluebook loads (`an aggregate that is identified names a field`, `an entity
    # is known by a field`), so by the time anything is dispatched there is
    # always a path here to follow.
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    #   Identity.scalar("number.value", account_number_value_object)  # => "acct-1"

      # The head names the ATTRIBUTE and is consumed by whoever looked the value
      # up; what is left is the walk down into it. A path with no fields to walk
      # — an aggregate that declares no identity and falls back to `id` — hands
      # back what it was given, because there is nothing declared to dig for.

      # THE IDENTITY IS THE JOIN OF ITS PARTS, in declaration order. Shared by

      # declares an identity the same shape a head does, so it derives one the
      # same way. `construct` answers `identity_paths` / `identity_heads` /
      # `attribute` (an Aggregate or an Entity, either one) ; `value_owner`
      # answers for coercion (`Value.for_attribute`'s first argument), which for
      # an entity is its OWNING aggregate — an entity's value objects resolve
      # through the aggregate's namespace, not its own.
