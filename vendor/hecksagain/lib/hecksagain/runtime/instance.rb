      # attribute (Item.id, say) would otherwise have its clean scalar

      # A COPY A MUTATION MAY TOUCH. Every adapter but Memory hands `find`
      # a freshly-decoded Instance already; Memory's holds the record it
      # eventually saves — the SAME state Hash, aliased. Before `ensures`
      # existed, nothing could refuse between apply_mutations and save, so
      # that aliasing was invisible: a dispatch either ran to completion or
      # raised before touching state at all. `ensures` is the first refusal
      # to sit AFTER mutation, and it found the bug the moment it did — an
      # in-memory record left half-mutated by a dispatch that then refused.
      # `command_interpreter`/`entity_interpreter` hydrate an EXISTING
      # record through this, never through the adapter's own return value
      # directly, so a refused ensures leaves the stored record untouched
      # regardless of which adapter is holding it.
