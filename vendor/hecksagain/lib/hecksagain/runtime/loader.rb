      # `false` to skip it: `Facade::Surface.install` puts a bare global
      # Ruby constant on `Object` per domain AND per aggregate name, with
      # no scoping and no cleanup hook, so a tool booting arbitrary
      # throwaway domains under generic names ("Widget", "Item", "Tag")
      # would otherwise leak those names into the rest of the process —
      # measured, not hypothetical: this exact leak once made an
      # unrelated `dsl_spec.rb` example resolve a bare `Widget` constant
      # to a stale smoke-test facade from a deleted temp directory instead
      # of raising, corrupting that spec's own unrelated build. Skipping
      # the install is safe because nothing downstream of a raw
      # `Dispatcher` needs the sugar — `Dispatcher#dispatch`/`#query` work
      # identically either way.

      # boot — every spec, every `bin/console` session — the moment
