// THE REHYDRATE-AND-REPLAY JOURNAL — flat, non-era-aware, and
// deliberately domain-agnostic: one table for the WHOLE domain's
// command history, not one per aggregate. Rust has no era/lineage
// concept at all (a known, already-documented gap from ADR 0011), and
// rust/host has no type information about aggregates/commands (that
// knowledge lives only inside the compiled `.wasm` module, which this
// crate treats as opaque) — so filtering "which prior commands matter
// for this one" isn't something rust/host can safely do on its own.
// Replaying the FULL log on every invocation is the simplest correct
// answer for a company-internal tool with modest total event volume;
// see docs/decisions/0018-rehydrate-replay-lambda-host.md for the full
// tradeoff.
//
// Determinism is what makes this safe to persist selectively: every
// prior journal row was, by construction, a command that succeeded the
// first time it was dispatched — replaying the exact same steps against
// the exact same (empty-start) kernel must produce the exact same
// result again. So the ONLY step in a full replay that can legitimately
// end up in `refusals` is the newest one, appended last. That's the
// entire correctness argument `append_if_accepted` below leans on.
