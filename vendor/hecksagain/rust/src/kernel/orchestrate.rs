// HAND-WRITTEN, ONCE, GENERIC — a direct port of `Dispatcher#dispatch`'s
// own reaction plumbing (lib/hecksagain/runtime/dispatcher.rb, read
// directly): every command dispatch runs its OWN pipeline, then hands
// each event it announced to policy matching AND process-manager
// advancement, re-entering dispatch for whatever either fires —
// recursively, inside the SAME call, bounded by a reaction-depth ceiling
// rather than a queue or a separate tick. `PolicyInterpreter#react`+
// `SagaInterpreter#advance` are the Ruby originals this ports; both run
// off the SAME announced-event list, in the same order Ruby runs them in
// (`announced.each { @policies.react }`, THEN `announced.each { @sagas.
// advance }`), which is why they're one function here too, not two.
//
// NOT the reaction/saga LOG (`registry.reaction_log`/`saga_log`) — nothing
// in `bin/rust_conformance`'s own comparable surface (`instances`,
// `events`, `refusals`) reads those, so this kernel produces the correct
// SIDE EFFECTS without also building a byte-for-byte log to match. A real,
// separate gap if a future need ever wants to inspect the log itself, not
// silently pretended away.
//
// ALSO NOT REPLICATED: `Correlation#saga_correlation`'s full three-tier
// resolution (dotted lookup into the CURRENT event's payload; else a
// `saga_correlation:` stamp carried on the event itself; else
// `Naming.reference_key` on the event's own aggregate). Only the first
// tier is ported — the one every real handler in this corpus's process
// managers actually needs, confirmed by tracing `spec/corpus/banking.json`
// against the live Ruby runtime before this was written. A real, separate
// gap if a future process manager ever needs the other two tiers.
